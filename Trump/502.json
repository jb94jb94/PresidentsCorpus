{"id":502,"author":"Donald Trump","title":"Speech: Donald Trump in Keene, NH","date":"2015-09-30","link":"https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-keene-nh-september-30-2015","paragraphs":["... let's win by a lot, but we're way up. Another one, Morning Consult, we're at 36. Ben is at 12. Carly is at 10. Marco is at 9. And Ted Cruz is at 7. So that's pretty good, right? We're 36 to 12. What is this, 31 to 14 to 8 to Jeb? Oh, Jeb got in there. Good.","And Mike Huckabee, good guy is at 7. So, we're doing great there. You know, the funny one -- and I always say this, but it just sort of got finalized -- I felt I did good in the debate even though I was being asked too many questions, right? And the funny thing is, you know, for two hours they were asking me questions after question, somebody said 47 percent were at to me or about me. In other words, well, they will ask somebody like one of the other candidates. Donald Trump is not a good person -- what do you think about? I'm standing here like this.","And then in the final 45 minutes, they couldn't ask me any questions because they asked me so many. It was embarrassing. I even apologize that I'm the one that's doing it. And they said, Donald Trump decided to take off in the last part of the\" -- and I'm saying","So the polls just came out on the debate. And the Drudge poll, 680,000 votes. Drudge, which is an amazing -- he is an amazing guy. And its Donald Trump 51 percent, he won; Carly at 23 percent, who did a good job, by the way; Marco at seven and Ted Cruz at six. The Time magazine poll -- and Time Magazine, I have no influence over Time magazine even though I was on the cover last week, right?","But Time magazine has Trump winning 55 percent for Trump, 20 percent for Carly, 7 percent for Marco Rubio, and I'm saying to myself, Gee","I thought I did fine. And they were just trying to beat me up, whoa. But I thought we did good and I think we're doing well. And the most important poll, like the one, the U.S.A Suffolk that just came out a couple of hours ago, that's fantastic.","So I want to thank everybody in the room and the other rooms that are filled up, who we'll see in a little while, but those -- those people...","New Hampshire -- I'll tell you what, it's an amazing place. It's a great, great state. It's a great state. A friend of mine from New York said, What are people from New Hampshire like?\" Can you believe this questions I get? I get -- I'm being honest. \"What do they like?\" I say","We are all in the same boat and we are going to straight it out, we are going to make America great again, that I can tell you. We are going to make it great again.","You know a thing came out, I was going to save it for a little bit later, but you know, we made that horrible Iran deal. And I just wrote this down. I was watching one of the networks and they said, we should have the prisoners released","We are giving them $150 billion. We got nothing except defeat because we don't win anymore as a country. We're going to win so much. We don't win anymore as a country. It's really embarrassing. So I actually tweeted this before. Do you believe this?","Iran wants to trade our three prisoners -- by the way, we have four prisoners, they are talking about three. The fourth, they've not even talking about. So they want to trade our three prisoners for 19 prisoners held by the United States and many other things. I mean how stupid are we? How stupid are we? And it's just going to change. It's going to change. It's just going to change -- so embarrassing.","Bergdahl, Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl; they get five killers that they wanted so badly. You remember Bergdahl? He left. he left, he deserted, and we have five and probably, six people killed going after him. And the other day I read for the first time, well, he wasn't feeling well, he may not be psychological -- who the hell cares?","And I think he might get off with nothing. Six people died; six people. And he was a deserter. Now in the old days, while we were strong, what did we do with deserters? That's right, there was no deserting. You deserted, you have problems. He deserves -- well, it's kind of psychological -- you know, we let him off. He's nice person, right? I don't think so.","So a lot of the press has been nice to us in the last few days because we gave a very detailed tax policy, where we substantially reduce taxes.","Very substantial.","And I'm going to over it, but we are going to create a lot of jobs, or taking jobs back from China and all these other that have just been ripping us. Ripping us -- Mexico, China, Japan, we are going to be taking them back. But you know, they were so happy in a certain way, they said, well","So I gave policy on immigration and they were sort of happy with that. They didn't necessarily agree with everything. A lot of people don't agree, build a wall.\" They say","Our trade deficit with Mexico is $45 billion a year. Don't forget I said Mexico -- I love Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I've thousands and thousands of Mexican people that have worked with me over the years -- thousands. I have a great relationship, but their leaders I've said all time, are too smart for our leaders, too cunning, too sharp, and they are ripping us.","So we have a deficit. And Nabisco is moving -- Nabisco, what's more United States than Nabisco? They're moving to Mexico from Chicago. They're going to make Oreos in Mexico. Now, think of it. And then we have Ford, motor company, $ 2.5 billion plant. You heard that story, I'm not going to tell it because if I do, they'll kill me. You know, I have all these live television sets.","You know, every other candidate can go and make a speech, every other candidate. And they make the same speech for months, but they have a hundred people. For instance, Jeb Bush is down the road, they're expecting a 125 people tonight.","No, it's true. Now I'm going to tell you because we have been getting amazing crowds. We had 20,000 people on Friday in Oklahoma, 20,000 people.","In Oklahoma, a great place. That was an amazing event. We had 20,000 people. We filled up a stadium -- you know with a Mavericks player Mark Cuban, good guy, and he asked the Mavericks, and it's called American Airlines Center. That's in Dallas, 20,000 people showed up. Some were so far up, I said, can you see me?\"\"\"n Oklahoma","And we had three days to do it because when we got it, back when they said, You know","Then we want to Mobile, Alabama as you know. Just before that, we had 35,000 people. It's been amazing. So tonight -- and I want accurate counts because these people, they don't count heads. You know, they'll say, Yeah","Because you know what they do, they have the camera, live television on my face, the entire amount. My wife goes -- I go home. were there any people there tonight","And we love the Fire Marshals, but the Fire Marshal actually, right over here, the Fire Marshal said, you can't have them in aisles.\" Now","But they don't want to have -- so anyway, we have 3,564 people. We have close circuit, it's amazing. It's great and it's always like this, by the way. It's always like this. We did have one event, so beautiful in South Carolina.","I was called by a friend of mine who is African-American, a great guy. The South Carolina African-American Chamber of Commerce, he wrote the most beautiful letter tonight -- I said, I was going to read it to you.\" He put it in one of the papers. It was in one of the papers today","I went -- and actually, they didn't come from the back, they just formed in the front, it was beautiful. And they -- they said it was the biggest crowd, the best crowd they've ever had. It was such a beautiful day. It was a lunch and it was wonderful. And the cameras -- because they were all up front, the cameras showed chairs in the back that were empty, like, Oh","And I just walk in did them a favor, and these people was so angry at the way they were -- African-American people, that do such a great job and you have to see the letter. Anybody who wants it we have it because it's -- it was such a beautiful letter. And so unfair the way they were treated and the event was treated. And that's why, when I go to things like this, I like to have the press see what's going on because there is a movement going on. This is more than like, Oh gee","When Bush has 125 people and when Rubio comes in, and then you have 12 people? It's true. And when all of the other ones -- I don't want to say about everybody because some of them, I really like, but nobody has crowds like us, nobody. Including Bernie, who does pretty well. No, nobody.","And the fact is something is happening, something incredible is happening. So what's gone on is we put in policy on immigration, and that's build a wall, people have to come into the country legally, have to do it. Have to do it. Have to do it.","Or we don't have a country.","The anchor babies, we -- we're going to have to do something there. And, by the way, when I first brought that up, you know people come in, they're in -- the other side, they're on the other side of the border. They have a baby that walks across the border because nobody stops anybody. You know, it's like we're open territory.","The woman has a baby on our land and the United States, now we have to take care of that baby for 85 years, that baby become a citizen. And I said, It can't be.\" And everybody said","People are coming from China. They're coming from all over Asia. They're coming from Latin America, South America, they're coming from Mexico. They walk across the border, it's ours, it doesn't read that way. And I didn't think -- you know they said, Oh","And so many different things, right? But it's not working that way, it's wrong. And I turned out to be right because the real scholars said, he's right.\" Now maybe it's going be -- no","Because I've had so many friends that I've made. First of all, you know Kate -- magnificent Kate; shot in the back and killed in San Francisco, sanctuary city. Can you believe -- I have property in San Francisco. I own a big chunk of the Bank of America building, can you believe it? I just feel -- I feel when I hear San Francisco, I also felt so good..","Now you learn about sanctuary cities -- the State of Florida, had sanctuary cities while Jeb Bush was governor, nobody said anything. And you know I have gotten very friendly, very, very friendly with a lot of the people because I've become -- it's become a very important issue for me; the whole thing with illegal immigration and crime. It is far worse than anybody in this room understands. It's far worse, far worse. Tremendous people come in, but you have some terrible, terrible problem. Terrible problem -- the other week, as you saw, that got a lot of press, a woman, 66-year-old veteran, raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant. Just came in and killed her, 66-year- old veteran, killed here. And that's happening all over. We are going to stop it. We are going to stop it. We going to have a wall...","And I'm really good at walls, believe me, it's what I do great. I build -- what I do better than any -- that's why, with the infrastructure of the country, it's falling apart. We are spending money all over the world. We don't even know where we spending money.","I was going to bring up today to have a list of some of the dumb things that the country does. One of them was a washer. You know the washer is? That's where the screw, you got the washer, you got a little extra grip.","So it's a two cent washer, and by the time it went from -- I think it was South Carolina to Texas, it was the cutest route. It cost $988,000 to have it delivered over a long period of time. There are so many things like that. There are so many things. There are item after item -- hammers that you buy for $7, $8, selling for thousands; that we buy as a country, with thousands of dollars.","Some people are getting really rich. Who are these people that are making these deals? You are probably saying, maybe I do too","And I get a lot of credit for coming out with immigration. Some people don't agree they think it's harsh. Some people think it's great. You know, Dwight Eisenhower was a wonderful general and a respected president, and he moved a million people out of the country.","Nobody said anything about it. When Trump does it, it's like ugh.\" When Eisenhower -- that was \"fine\" -- \"whatever\" -- \"he was allowed to do it\" -- you know","That's when we had borders. You know, without borders, you don't have a country, essentially. We don't have a country, we have -- without borders, you just don't have it. But Dwight Eisenhower in these big reports, and -- they used to take him out and put him on the other side of the border, say, you have to stay here.\" And they come right back","And they took it out and moved them all the way south, all the way. And they never came back again, because it was too far, amazing. And I'm not saying this in a joking way. I'm saying this is what happened. It wasn't working, they were coming right back and then they literally, literally, moved them all the way. And I have to tell you, a lot of the politicians -- they never came back because it was too far.","They put them on boats and all the way down south and that was it. But then, a lot of things happened and a lot of changes took place. And now it will become so politically correct, as a country that we can't even walk. We can't think properly. We can't do anything. Every time you say something, oh","Nobody respects women more than I do. I will tell you, and I use -- that's true. And I will do more -- thank you.","That's true. My mother was the greatest person there was. But nobody respects women more than I do. And two weeks, as I'm making a speech, I said, I respect women.\" I cherish women. I do","I think you want to be cherished too, yeah, it's better than respect -- it's everything. You want to be respected, you want to be loved, you want to be cherished, you want to be everything, I think -- am I right, women or wrong? I've mean -- you know...","And nobody cares more than I do. And I will tell you, women's health issues where, Jeb Bush recently said that, he's not going to fund them.\" Then he said","Now, we are going to take care of our women, but we are going to take care of our vets, we're going take care of everyone-- we're going to really take care of people, because I know how to do it. We're going to bring jobs back into the country, we're going to become a rich a country again. We are a poor country.","We are a poor country. We're a dead-end nation. We owe $19 trillion though -- for a few months have been saying now it's up to 19. We owe China, $1.5 trillion. Think of it, they take our jobs, they take our base, they take our money, and we owe them $1.5 trillion.","How does it work? That's like a magic act. We owe Japan the exact same amount, $1.5 trillion. We owe them. They send million of cars here. We pay for the cars. They have no tax, no nothing. By the way, try doing business in Japan. I always say, how many Chevrolets do you think you are going to find in the middle of Tokyo? Maybe none? Do you think none? There might none.","We sell them beef and they don't want it, beef. And they don't want it, they send it back, the farmers don't want it. So we owe Japan $1.5 trillion. Think of it, they sell us all these cars, we owe them money, on top of everything else. It's going to stop. It's going stop so easy. It's so easy. We have to balance out.","I went to my people this week and I said, I want to know something. I want to know how much do we","No, no, much less than half the price because I know how to build. I know -- I watch it myself. Oh, it's going to be so beautiful, it's going work so well.","It's going work so well -- you see the big picture of the big magazine this weekend? I knew the magazine because I was on the cover, that's the only reason I read it.","But they have a wall like -- probably, eight or nine feet and they have a ramp going up and another ramp going down. They have cars and truck going over, taking drugs. So here's the deal. We get the drugs, they get the money. These trucks get right over the ramp, over the wall. They can't do that when the wall is higher the ceiling. Or it's a long way down if they miss the ramp, I'll tell you. It's a long way.","And I don't blame if people can get away with this stuff; let them get away with it. But we are going to make our country so strong and so beautiful, we going do it. So then, I put on something in on policy with regard to the Second Amendment. I'm a big Second Amendment person. And I -- we've all seen it.","And in two weeks, this is something that I've really got to know a lot about; we are going take care of our vets. I'm going to put in a policy paper on the veterans and the veterans administration. And I know what to do. These guys -- it's not even the money. We spend so much money, but we have all thieves, tremendous corruption.","A few weeks ago, on Wednesday, we had the longest wait in the history of the veteran's administration. They were in the waiting room. They waited days to see a doctor, they are dying. You saw that, you saw the reports, hard to believe. So many people are dying while they are waiting.","They are dying. Things that could be taken care of with a pill, with -- a couple of visits, with maybe one visit and they are dying. It's not going to happen anymore. It is not going happen anymore.","So that's what I really look forward to and that one is going to be -- and I'll tell you just briefly, I mean, it is common sense. When they are waiting too long, they going to go to a private doctor, private hospital, public hospital, whatever the hell is in the city, we are going to pay the bill, and then we're going to take care of these people, OK? We're going to take care of them.","So -- and it's so important to me because some of the greatest people -- I've met some of the greatest people I've met on this trail. We called it -- do you believe I'm a politician? I can't believe it. I'm so embarrassed. People say, You're a politician\" and I say","But I guess it a certain well, I am for a little while, and hopefully it works out, and we're going just do something that's going to be wonderful, and you are going be very happy. So, good, go ahead, you can go ahead.","You know, it's funny. A few weeks ago, I got a great story and they said, he's a great speaker","And I said, you know -- but you know why? Because I'm so excited to tell you about the next thing","So I appreciate it the article, and the guy is right actually, but although I don't know, who knows? So what I did is we came up with a really great tax plan that has been really praised, and some cases not, they said it's too big. It's too big, we've got to put our country back to work.","We have the highest taxes in the entire world, highest in the world. Our corporations are leaving our country because the taxes are too high. And they did a very sophisticated, very beautifully detailed policy paper. Now, a lot of the press would say, prior to that especially, and the Second Amendment and frankly, immigration, they said, oh. He talks well, but he doesn't talk --","You know I went to great schools. I'm like a smart person. It's like, oh, he doesn't talk details. So all of a sudden, I'm speaking details and even if they don't like the details, they appreciate it that I gave them the details. I will tell you, the tax plan is, I think, -- really something we are proud of.","And I'm going to go over just quickly because most of you have heard it, but it's going to help you. It's going to help with a lot of ways. Number one, is it's going help with jobs. It's going help with jobs, it's going put people to work. We are taking jobs back.","We are going to have -- we are going to have companies now, come back into our country. We are going to have a lower tax rate than China. We are going have a lower tax rate than many of these countries.","You know what corporate inversion is? Corporate inversion is a disaster. Companies have billions, trillions, at least, 2 1/2 trillion total, outside of the country. Everybody agrees the money should be allowed to come back in. Republicans, democrats, this have been going on for years, they still can't agree. They agree, but can't come to a conclusion.","And, if we bring that 2 1/2 trillion -- and I'll tell you what a bigger number than that, and if it is, my plan is even better. But I'm letting it come in for a very reasonable price, meaning, a very reasonable tax. Right now the tax is so high, you can't bring it.","If anybody was running one of those companies, you can't get it in. They work on paperwork and they can't get it in. Smart, they have the greatest lawyers, they can't get the money in.","So I'm going to simplify it. I want the money to come in so that these companies -- number one, don't go. You know what they do, a lot of them leave, you know this, in order to get the money. They actually move their company to Ireland, to other places in Europe, to other places in the world in order to get the money.","And you have some big incredible companies, big named companies that are now thinking of leaving the United States, to get the money, and to get lower taxes. And there's really no way you can stop that. You can't say it is illegal because they'll find their way around it.","The only thing that stops it is the marketplace. The marketplace is going stop it. So we are going to take care of that, but we have an -- I sort of titled it tax reform that will make America great again. Today, they said it's very Reagan-esque. I consider that a great compliment -- one of the writers, one of the writers said that.","And -- thank you. And I start off, too few Americans are working, too many jobs are being shipped overseas, and too many middle income families just cannot make ends meet. We all know it. And if it is not you, you know people where that's the case.","My plan directly meets these challenges, and the challenges also of business. We are going make our business strong again. We're going to make them competitive again.","And by the way, nothing to do with this, but we're going to get rid of the regulations that are the mounting up like on a daily basis it's ridiculous. Regulations are going to go to wayside.","There will be some, but they will be meaningful. They won't be the nonsense that every single day is happening, every single day. The plan will provide major tax relief for middle income and most other Americans, major tax relief. It will totally simplify the tax code.","We'll grow the American economy and all of this will add up to a point where we're not going to be increasing our debt. If anything, if it really kicks in like I think it might, where the economy grows, we'll start reducing our debt, and reducing it big league, which I want to do.","And again, it's -- I know the people I'm running against; and I know democrats and republicans. They can't do this, folks. I'm really good at it. Who's better at that than I am? Who's better? Is there anybody?","I've had borrowing so big and I worked out perfectly to companies bigger, better, stronger than ever before, that's what you need. You need somebody with whatever the hell that is, whatever that craziness is up there, you need that. You need that.","You can't just be a politician, all talk, no action, they talk. They wouldn't know what to do with China. Carl Icahn, great entrepreneur, everybody knows Carl Icahn. He came out. Yesterday, he said, Trump is the only one that knows what he's talking about.\" And he's great. And I'll get him involved.\"\"ou can't just be a politician","I'll say, Carl","That will go away very rapidly, and we'll get along. China doesn't even like us. You know these countries, they rip us up. They don't even like us. With me, I'll stop the rip off and they'll like us, can you believe it? Hard to believe, but that's what will happen.","So in the plan, we're going to cut the individual rates from -- and this is very important. Number one, we're cutting down from seven brackets to four, and the rates are going from; 25, to 20, to 10, and to zero. When somebody's not making enough to live, what's the purpose of them doing lengthy returns, going to get help from H&R block, who we intend to put out of business because it's so ridiculous, so ridiculous.","In order to pay us what -- I mean, these people need help. They're not doing well. So what's the purpose? Plus, the bookkeeping, it will be a tremendous percentage, but in many -- and some are not paying now anyway, but they have to go through this process, it's brutal.","So we're going to simplify, but think of it, 25 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent, and it's -- that's a major reduction. And some people say it's too big a reduction, some of the great geniuses that haven't made a dollar in their life; not a dollar. They haven't created one job -- well","What's the purpose? What is the purpose? We eliminate the marriage penalty, which is a killer for so many people, a killer. What's the purpose of that? And by the way, everyone agrees and they can't get it done. We eliminate the AMT, which is the Alternative Minimum tax, we eliminate it.","We end the death tax. It's a double taxation. It's a double taxation.","I mean a lot of you, as an example, in New Hampshire. You have a store, you have a little building, you have something -- you leave it to your kids, the kids get a tax bill where they have to pay 35 and even 50 percent estate taxes. Now, they mortgage up the business, the bank ends up taking it over because they have to pay the estate taxes, and you've been paying taxes all the while. It's double taxation and it has to end. So many businesses have been destroyed by the death tax or the estate tax, as people like to call it, but so many businesses. That's very important.","Our plan reduces and/or totally eliminates most of the deductions and repos available to special interests. Who, by the way, are supporting Bush and Rubio and most of them; and Hillary, big league Hillary, big league Bush.","You know, Bush is going to spend $100 million on ads. That money comes from friends of mine. Their friends, I know most -- some are enemies. Some of them I don't like. Actually, many of them I don't like, but...","But, when you see an ad, every time you see an ad from Rubio, or Bush, or Hillary, remember, that money is coming from special interests and lobbyists. And when they want something done, in a year from now, two years from now, if they ever get in, it would be sad, won't that be sad? If Trump doesn't make it, won't that be a terrible thing?","But when that money gets spent on, you know, millions, $25 million -- Jeb today, put in an order, I hear, $25 million for ads. Well, what do you do when you're weak on immigration and you're in favor of common corps, how do you solve that problem with ads? I don't think you solve it.","Rubio, the same thing, he's very, very, very weak on immigration. A member of the gang of eight, totally weak on immigration. How do you solve a problem, when you say people can just pour in? Made a speech not so long ago, in Spanish, saying, he wants to open up the borders essentially.\" He didn't want you people hearing it. So he made the speech in Spanish. \"\"ubio","That's true. But he's very weak on illegal immigration. And I don't think -- I'm not sure, I may be wrong, but whether you're Rubio or Bush -- I have to tell you one story, do you mind? So Bush is the mentor of Rubio. And everybody said, this is politics at its lowest and worst -- I can't stand these politicians, right?","So Bush is the mentor. And he goes out and he says, yes","So everyone said, Rubio will never run\" The great genius pundits","He was very young. He runs. And they ask Bush, What do you think of Rubio?\" Rubio comes out and he's talking about Bush and you know. \"What do you think of Rubio?\" \"He's my dear friend. He's so wonderful. I love him so much.\"\"\"e was very young. He runs. And they ask Bush","Then there's Rubio, who's running against Bush, and he's -- you know probably shouldn't be from a loyalty standpoint. The veterans know what I mean about loyalty, right? Right? Right? So they ask Rubio, What do you think of Bush?\" \"Oh","They hate so much. They hate more than anybody in this room hates their neighbor, any.","But it's political bullshit, do you understand? It's true. It's true.","So, let's go. So we're going to reduce or eliminate most of the deductions, loopholes available to special interests and the very rich. Me? I don't like that. Maybe I'll change my mind on that one, I don't know, going to cost me a lot. While preserving charitable giving, which is important, and giving mortgage interest deductions -- we want to leave the mortgage interest. You know, a couple of the plans -- yeah, you got to have it.","You know, a lot of people were worried about real estate. Try taking the mortgage interest deduction out, you'll see what's going to happen to real estate. You want to see a crash? Try that one.","So we end the current tax treatment of carried interest. It's a little complicated stuff, but the business folks know what that means. For speculative partnerships, that do not grow businesses or create jobs and they're not risking their own capital.","That's what happens, they get this big thing, they're not risking their own capital, and it's a big number. Somebody said it's not so big.\" It's a big number","And a lot of the hedge fund guys, they are not happy with me right now, but they're nice. But they didn't give me anything, they want to. You know as soon as you go to number one, that puts amazing how many guys call up Don","I don't want it. Am I making a mistake? I feel sort of like it's like -- it's not natural to me. I'm turning down a lot of money, believe me. I hope it's appreciated someday. No, honestly. No, honestly.","Because, if I turn down tens of millions of dollars and I lose, I will feel so stupid, really. So it didn't matter. So I hope it's appreciated. No business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a Mom and Pop Shop, how many people own a shop? Raise your hand, great business, right? OK? Were you in the same category now because the taxes are too high, is that right?","So no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a Mom and Pop Shop, to a freelancer, you have a lot of them up in New Hampshire. Freelancers, plenty of freelancers, living from gig to gig, will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes.","We're not going to take all the money away anymore. And people aren't going to create jobs if you do that. So we're going to have jobs, this is a job creator. This is real. This will be really dynamic. This will be something special.","Now a lot of people that don't know, they don't get it, but many people that do really get it. A one-time deemed repatriation, that's what I was talking about, all the money coming back in, of the corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted rate of 10 percent. In other words, we're going to tax them 10 percent. They're going to have the money in our country, instead of having it overseas.","Tax rate of 10 percent, and ends to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. So that, what you're going to do is, you're going to have tremendous incentives for people even if they're doing business abroad, but you're going to bring the money back in to the United States. And they're going to put the money back to work, even if they just give it out in dividends because the people getting the dividends, they're going to spend the money. And you're talking about trillions of dollars are over there. Trillions of dollars, and believe me, mark my words. I told you before, they say, it is $2.5 trillion","So corporate inversion, we're going to stop, and we're going to have companies not leave. In the old days, people would leave New York and they'd go to Florida or they'd leave New Jersey, they'd go to Texas, where the taxes are lower.","Now they leave the United States and they go to Ireland and they go to other countries where they have lower tax rates and other things. But with what I'm doing, they're not going to be leaving anymore. And we don't have to say, boom, you're staying. They're not going to leave anymore. So it really works.","What we want to do now is reduce or eliminate many of the business loopholes because we're lowering their taxes so much, that we can get rid of these tremendously complicated loopholes. And in the end, the business taxes are going to be lower than they were before substantially, but you're not going to have accountants, where you have tax returns that go up through the ceiling, if you have a business. It's going be simple. It's going be less taxes and it's going be simple.","So we're going to be in a position to do some amazing things. And I've gotten just so many people are so thrilled with what I said about taxes. And I thought I'd review it for you. I did this the other day at Trump tower, and we had a great turnout. And as I said, we had just amazing response.","So let's talk a little bit about ISIS and let's talk about our country. We spent -- thank you. We spent so much money, so much money in the Middle East, just spent trillions. Just in Iraq, $2 trillion. Just in Iraq. Not to mention, even more importantly, the lives and the wounded warriors who I love, who I love. These are the greatest of all. We don't take care of them properly, but these are the greatest of them all, the wounded warriors.","So we have a president who doesn't know what he's doing. We have a president who looked like -- remember, he said they were the JV, that ISIS was the JV? Well, he looked like the JV last week, when you compared him to Putin in New York, the JV.","So now we have Putin, said, I'm going into Syria. And I'm going to knock the hell out of ISIS.\" He said. And I'm saying","The problem we have is we have a president who is not respected by Putin, just not respected. He leaves New York, leaves the United Nations, couple of days later, he's got massive amounts of artillery and planes and everything else. all very quickly done. We would never act like that --we would never act like that.","I saw one of your generals. I won't mention his name, one of your top generals the other day, active. They said, What do you do about ISIS","Do you think he would say that? I don't know?","He'd smacked the reporter in the face, kick him in the lips --he would give a smack to that guy. Or General Douglas Macarthur. The highest marks in the -- I'm a big person for academia, I believe in it. The highest marks in the history of west point; General Macarthur, a great general. Can you imagine him saying, I don't know what we do about\" -- these guys know","But we have people that don't know. Either they don't know or they're being so constrained by politics that they're afraid to say. But we have to be tough and we have to be smart. At the same time, I want to rebuild this country. We have bridges that are falling down. We have 60 percent of our bridges are in danger, 60 percent.","We have roadways that are coming apart. We have airports that are third world. You go over to Qatar, you go over to Saudi Arabia, you go over to some of these countries, China. You see airports the likes of which you have never, ever seen before. Then you come back and you land at Laguardia.","It's true. Pot holes, pot holes. You land at Laguardia or Newark or L.A.X. and you walk into a filthy terminal that's falling apart with broken terrazzo floors, and that's what we have. We used to be the leader. We have to rebuild our own country. And you know, when you owe $19 trillion and you want to take care of the vets and you want to build up the military because I will build up the military so big, so strong.","Nobody's going to mess with us, nobody, nobody. Now, with that being said, but you have to know when to use it. You have to know when, right? I mean, you have to know when. So in 2004 and 2003, I said, don't go into Iraq.\" I didn't know that much about Iraq","So I said, I don't know if they have weapons of mass destruction","That was in Reuters 2004, in June or July, a big story, Trump opposed to doing it.\" Now","I said, but why are we going after Iraq right now?\" The families went back to Saudi Arabia. They didn't go back to Iraq. I think one might have","But I said, you're going to destabilize the Middle East.\" So here's what happens","Their oil is unbelievable in Iraq, underground, one of the biggest in the world. So they totally take over and they're going to very soon, so we spend all this money, all these lives, all these wounded warriors, we get nothing. We got nothing because we have stupid leadership.","Now, if you know anything about the Soviet Union, if you want the real truth, the Soviet Union broke up because they spent so much money in Afghanistan, OK? They spent so much money that they were going bust and that's the primary reason or certainly one of the primary reasons that the Soviet Union broke up.","The Afghanistanian people, great fighters, always have been known. I have a friend of mine, he's a big war historian, among the best fighters, Afghanistan. So the Soviet Union -- so now, we have the Soviet Union wants to go to Syria, and they want to knock the hell out of people. And we're fighting Assad because Assad is our enemy, and we're fighting Syria.","Now Syria wants to fight Assad. Think of this, just put it together. You know, a lot of people -- I get a little credit, they say, oh","I guarantee you that Assad is sitting back saying, that president is one of the dumbest human beings on earth.\" It's true. \"\" guarantee you that Assad is sitting back saying","So you have ISIS that wants to fight Assad and ISIS can't because we're bombing them. We're not doing the job, but we're certainly, you know, hurting them. So they're not going after Assad. Now, you have Russia and Iran. Now, Iran became powerful because we gave them so much money, aside from the nuclear, which they will have, believe me.","But we gave them $150 billion. So now they're feeling, there are going to be terrorists all over the world, they have so much money. And to them $150 billion, that's real money, with us, not the same.","So now you have Iran and you have Russia on the side of Assad, but they both want -- Russia does want ISIS out because they don't want them coming into Russia. They don't want them crossing borders and they don't want them coming into Russia. Y","You have the migration because Syria's such a disaster. And now I hear we want to take in 200,000 Syrians, right? And they could be -- listen, they could be ISIS. I don't know. Did you ever see a migration like that? They're all men, and they're all strong-looking guys. Did you see it? They're walking and there are so many men, there aren't that many women. And I'm saying to myself, why aren't they fighting to save Syria? Why are they migrating all over Europe? It's a serious thing.","So now, now you have this guy, Secretary Kerry, may be the worst negotiator. I think he will go down as the worst secretary of state than Hillary Clinton because of the deal. And she was terrible, but I think he's going to go down as worse because of this deal. So now you have him saying, we're going to take in maybe\"-- I mean","We have no idea. There's no identification, there's no anything. And I'll tell you right now, I'm putting everybody on notice, and hopefully this gets outside of this room and I guess it will with all these crazy cameras going back there. I'm putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria, as part of this mass migration, that if I win, if I win, they're going back. They're going back. I'm telling you. They're going back.","Because you know, military tactics are very interesting. This could be one of the great tactical ploys of all time, 200,000-man army, maybe, or if you said 50,000 or 80,000 or 100,000, we got problems. And that could be possible. I don't know that it is, but it could be possible. So they're going back. They're going back. I'm just telling them. So if they come, that's great. And if I lose, I guess they're staying. But if I win, they're going back. And I know a lot of people are saying, well","So tonight, I'm doing a show on CNN at 10 o'clock, and the question was asked to me, why don't you give us policy","It sounds terrible. I really know a lot about it. I think, I think my biggest -- I think other than jobs, everybody says. You know, CNN did a poll. I'm through the roof on jobs, through the roof on leadership. Through the roof on almost everything other than some people don't think I'm a nice person, I'm still low on that. But you know, ultimately -- I am a nice person, I love people. I want to help people. But you know -- thank you. You know...","Actually, you know where I do my best favorables in New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina because they got to know me. I'm here so much. Those are the places. So once I get out, I think people will find that. You know what I just want to do the right thing. And I tell the story about a woman who said, do you think you're nice enough to be...?\" I said","I had an article about, not so long ago, a business article. And I beat some group of people -- I love winning. I love it. And I beat this group for something that everybody wanted, I just beat them, and it turned out to be great. And one of my opponents, not in a bad way, but in a very respectful way, said, you know","And so does Patton and so do MacArthur, and so as anybody that's smart. So when they ask me about, like what I want to do with Syria?\" I know what I want to do","And maybe if you're unpredictable, the stupid people are going to say, Oh","Remember, when they were handing $50 million of cash, cash. They were going through Afghanistan paying off -- I want to know who are the soldiers that are carrying cash of $50 million -- cash. How stupid are we? I wouldn't be surprised -- if those soldiers, I wouldn't be that surprised if the cash didn't get there, I have to be honest. But, remember when Obama was saying, We will leave. We are leaving Iraq as of a certain date.\" Now the opponents said","What do we have to fight anymore for? Let's just wait a year and a half. That's what happened. And then as soon as we left, they knocked the shit out of everybody, right?","They just knocked the hell out of everybody. Obama, this great president of ours, we will leave. Remember, he gave a certain date, a date certain, we will be out. And these tough guys, these are tough fighters, especially, when they have something they want to fight for. They didn't want to fight for a corrupt government, but he gave a certain date.","So I want to be unpredictable, OK? I would never have given a date. I might have said we're going to stay there for 20 years. We're going to stay there for eternity. And these other guys would say, Oh","I mean, look. We shouldn't have been there, but we were doing OK toward the end, and then we took everybody out. But instead, if you would have said, No","Don't we want that as a thing, right?","So I love the people of New Hampshire. I love you.","I love the people of this country and I didn't really want to do this. I did something -- I have this -- people actually thought I wouldn't run because it say -- what, why would he do this? It's hard, nasty.","The press is horrible, even not all of it, but horrible.

And Ted Cruz is at 7. So that's pretty good, right? We're 36 to 12. What is this, 31 to 14 to 8 to Jeb? Oh, Jeb got in there. Good. And Mike Huckabee, good guy is at 7. So, we're doing great there. You know, the funny one -- and I always say this, but it just sort of got finalized -- I felt I did good in the debate even though I was being asked too many questions, right? And the funny thing is, you know, for two hours they were asking me questions after question, somebody said 47 percent were at to me or about me. In other words, well, they will ask somebody like one of the other candidates. Donald Trump is not a good person -- what do you think about? I'm standing here like this. And then in the final 45 minutes, they couldn't ask me any questions because they asked me so many. It was embarrassing. I even apologize that I'm the one that's doing it. And they said, Donald Trump decided to take off in the last part of the\" -- and I'm saying So the polls just came out on the debate. And the Drudge poll, 680,000 votes. Drudge, which is an amazing -- he is an amazing guy. And its Donald Trump 51 percent, he won; Carly at 23 percent, who did a good job, by the way; Marco at seven and Ted Cruz at six. The Time magazine poll -- and Time Magazine, I have no influence over Time magazine even though I was on the cover last week, right? But Time magazine has Trump winning 55 percent for Trump, 20 percent for Carly, 7 percent for Marco Rubio, and I'm saying to myself, Gee I thought I did fine. And they were just trying to beat me up, whoa. But I thought we did good and I think we're doing well. And the most important poll, like the one, the U.S.A Suffolk that just came out a couple of hours ago, that's fantastic. So I want to thank everybody in the room and the other rooms that are filled up, who we'll see in a little while, but those -- those people... New Hampshire -- I'll tell you what, it's an amazing place. It's a great, great state. It's a great state. A friend of mine from New York said, What are people from New Hampshire like?\" Can you believe this questions I get? I get -- I'm being honest. \"What do they like?\" I say We are all in the same boat and we are going to straight it out, we are going to make America great again, that I can tell you. We are going to make it great again. You know a thing came out, I was going to save it for a little bit later, but you know, we made that horrible Iran deal. And I just wrote this down. I was watching one of the networks and they said, we should have the prisoners released We are giving them $150 billion. We got nothing except defeat because we don't win anymore as a country. We're going to win so much. We don't win anymore as a country. It's really embarrassing. So I actually tweeted this before. Do you believe this? Iran wants to trade our three prisoners -- by the way, we have four prisoners, they are talking about three. The fourth, they've not even talking about. So they want to trade our three prisoners for 19 prisoners held by the United States and many other things. I mean how stupid are we? How stupid are we? And it's just going to change. It's going to change. It's just going to change -- so embarrassing. Bergdahl, Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl; they get five killers that they wanted so badly. You remember Bergdahl? He left. he left, he deserted, and we have five and probably, six people killed going after him. And the other day I read for the first time, well, he wasn't feeling well, he may not be psychological -- who the hell cares? And I think he might get off with nothing. Six people died; six people. And he was a deserter. Now in the old days, while we were strong, what did we do with deserters? That's right, there was no deserting. You deserted, you have problems. He deserves -- well, it's kind of psychological -- you know, we let him off. He's nice person, right? I don't think so. So a lot of the press has been nice to us in the last few days because we gave a very detailed tax policy, where we substantially reduce taxes. Very substantial. And I'm going to over it, but we are going to create a lot of jobs, or taking jobs back from China and all these other that have just been ripping us. Ripping us -- Mexico, China, Japan, we are going to be taking them back. But you know, they were so happy in a certain way, they said, well So I gave policy on immigration and they were sort of happy with that. They didn't necessarily agree with everything. A lot of people don't agree, build a wall.\" They say Our trade deficit with Mexico is $45 billion a year. Don't forget I said Mexico -- I love Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I've thousands and thousands of Mexican people that have worked with me over the years -- thousands. I have a great relationship, but their leaders I've said all time, are too smart for our leaders, too cunning, too sharp, and they are ripping us. So we have a deficit. And Nabisco is moving -- Nabisco, what's more United States than Nabisco? They're moving to Mexico from Chicago. They're going to make Oreos in Mexico. Now, think of it. And then we have Ford, motor company, $ 2.5 billion plant. You heard that story, I'm not going to tell it because if I do, they'll kill me. You know, I have all these live television sets. You know, every other candidate can go and make a speech, every other candidate. And they make the same speech for months, but they have a hundred people. For instance, Jeb Bush is down the road, they're expecting a 125 people tonight. No, it's true. Now I'm going to tell you because we have been getting amazing crowds. We had 20,000 people on Friday in Oklahoma, 20,000 people. In Oklahoma, a great place. That was an amazing event. We had 20,000 people. We filled up a stadium -- you know with a Mavericks player Mark Cuban, good guy, and he asked the Mavericks, and it's called American Airlines Center. That's in Dallas, 20,000 people showed up. Some were so far up, I said, can you see me?\"\"\"n Oklahoma And we had three days to do it because when we got it, back when they said, You know Then we want to Mobile, Alabama as you know. Just before that, we had 35,000 people. It's been amazing. So tonight -- and I want accurate counts because these people, they don't count heads. You know, they'll say, Yeah Because you know what they do, they have the camera, live television on my face, the entire amount. My wife goes -- I go home. were there any people there tonight And we love the Fire Marshals, but the Fire Marshal actually, right over here, the Fire Marshal said, you can't have them in aisles.\" Now But they don't want to have -- so anyway, we have 3,564 people. We have close circuit, it's amazing. It's great and it's always like this, by the way. It's always like this. We did have one event, so beautiful in South Carolina. I was called by a friend of mine who is African-American, a great guy. The South Carolina African-American Chamber of Commerce, he wrote the most beautiful letter tonight -- I said, I was going to read it to you.\" He put it in one of the papers. It was in one of the papers today I went -- and actually, they didn't come from the back, they just formed in the front, it was beautiful. And they -- they said it was the biggest crowd, the best crowd they've ever had. It was such a beautiful day. It was a lunch and it was wonderful. And the cameras -- because they were all up front, the cameras showed chairs in the back that were empty, like, Oh And I just walk in did them a favor, and these people was so angry at the way they were -- African-American people, that do such a great job and you have to see the letter. Anybody who wants it we have it because it's -- it was such a beautiful letter. And so unfair the way they were treated and the event was treated. And that's why, when I go to things like this, I like to have the press see what's going on because there is a movement going on. This is more than like, Oh gee When Bush has 125 people and when Rubio comes in, and then you have 12 people? It's true. And when all of the other ones -- I don't want to say about everybody because some of them, I really like, but nobody has crowds like us, nobody. Including Bernie, who does pretty well. No, nobody. And the fact is something is happening, something incredible is happening. So what's gone on is we put in policy on immigration, and that's build a wall, people have to come into the country legally, have to do it. Have to do it. Have to do it. Or we don't have a country. The anchor babies, we -- we're going to have to do something there. And, by the way, when I first brought that up, you know people come in, they're in -- the other side, they're on the other side of the border. They have a baby that walks across the border because nobody stops anybody. You know, it's like we're open territory. The woman has a baby on our land and the United States, now we have to take care of that baby for 85 years, that baby become a citizen. And I said, It can't be.\" And everybody said People are coming from China. They're coming from all over Asia. They're coming from Latin America, South America, they're coming from Mexico. They walk across the border, it's ours, it doesn't read that way. And I didn't think -- you know they said, Oh And so many different things, right? But it's not working that way, it's wrong. And I turned out to be right because the real scholars said, he's right.\" Now maybe it's going be -- no Because I've had so many friends that I've made. First of all, you know Kate -- magnificent Kate; shot in the back and killed in San Francisco, sanctuary city. Can you believe -- I have property in San Francisco. I own a big chunk of the Bank of America building, can you believe it? I just feel -- I feel when I hear San Francisco, I also felt so good.. Now you learn about sanctuary cities -- the State of Florida, had sanctuary cities while Jeb Bush was governor, nobody said anything. And you know I have gotten very friendly, very, very friendly with a lot of the people because I've become -- it's become a very important issue for me; the whole thing with illegal immigration and crime. It is far worse than anybody in this room understands. It's far worse, far worse. Tremendous people come in, but you have some terrible, terrible problem. Terrible problem -- the other week, as you saw, that got a lot of press, a woman, 66-year-old veteran, raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant. Just came in and killed her, 66-year- old veteran, killed here. And that's happening all over. We are going to stop it. We are going to stop it. We going to have a wall... And I'm really good at walls, believe me, it's what I do great. I build -- what I do better than any -- that's why, with the infrastructure of the country, it's falling apart. We are spending money all over the world. We don't even know where we spending money. I was going to bring up today to have a list of some of the dumb things that the country does. One of them was a washer. You know the washer is? That's where the screw, you got the washer, you got a little extra grip. So it's a two cent washer, and by the time it went from -- I think it was South Carolina to Texas, it was the cutest route. It cost $988,000 to have it delivered over a long period of time. There are so many things like that. There are so many things. There are item after item -- hammers that you buy for $7, $8, selling for thousands; that we buy as a country, with thousands of dollars. Some people are getting really rich. Who are these people that are making these deals? You are probably saying, maybe I do too And I get a lot of credit for coming out with immigration. Some people don't agree they think it's harsh. Some people think it's great. You know, Dwight Eisenhower was a wonderful general and a respected president, and he moved a million people out of the country. Nobody said anything about it. When Trump does it, it's like ugh.\" When Eisenhower -- that was \"fine\" -- \"whatever\" -- \"he was allowed to do it\" -- you know That's when we had borders. You know, without borders, you don't have a country, essentially. We don't have a country, we have -- without borders, you just don't have it. But Dwight Eisenhower in these big reports, and -- they used to take him out and put him on the other side of the border, say, you have to stay here.\" And they come right back And they took it out and moved them all the way south, all the way. And they never came back again, because it was too far, amazing. And I'm not saying this in a joking way. I'm saying this is what happened. It wasn't working, they were coming right back and then they literally, literally, moved them all the way. And I have to tell you, a lot of the politicians -- they never came back because it was too far. They put them on boats and all the way down south and that was it. But then, a lot of things happened and a lot of changes took place. And now it will become so politically correct, as a country that we can't even walk. We can't think properly. We can't do anything. Every time you say something, oh Nobody respects women more than I do. I will tell you, and I use -- that's true. And I will do more -- thank you. That's true. My mother was the greatest person there was. But nobody respects women more than I do. And two weeks, as I'm making a speech, I said, I respect women.\" I cherish women. I do I think you want to be cherished too, yeah, it's better than respect -- it's everything. You want to be respected, you want to be loved, you want to be cherished, you want to be everything, I think -- am I right, women or wrong? I've mean -- you know... And nobody cares more than I do. And I will tell you, women's health issues where, Jeb Bush recently said that, he's not going to fund them.\" Then he said Now, we are going to take care of our women, but we are going to take care of our vets, we're going take care of everyone-- we're going to really take care of people, because I know how to do it. We're going to bring jobs back into the country, we're going to become a rich a country again. We are a poor country. We are a poor country. We're a dead-end nation. We owe $19 trillion though -- for a few months have been saying now it's up to 19. We owe China, $1.5 trillion. Think of it, they take our jobs, they take our base, they take our money, and we owe them $1.5 trillion. How does it work? That's like a magic act. We owe Japan the exact same amount, $1.5 trillion. We owe them. They send million of cars here. We pay for the cars. They have no tax, no nothing. By the way, try doing business in Japan. I always say, how many Chevrolets do you think you are going to find in the middle of Tokyo? Maybe none? Do you think none? There might none. We sell them beef and they don't want it, beef. And they don't want it, they send it back, the farmers don't want it. So we owe Japan $1.5 trillion. Think of it, they sell us all these cars, we owe them money, on top of everything else. It's going to stop. It's going stop so easy. It's so easy. We have to balance out. I went to my people this week and I said, I want to know something. I want to know how much do we No, no, much less than half the price because I know how to build. I know -- I watch it myself. Oh, it's going to be so beautiful, it's going work so well. It's going work so well -- you see the big picture of the big magazine this weekend? I knew the magazine because I was on the cover, that's the only reason I read it. But they have a wall like -- probably, eight or nine feet and they have a ramp going up and another ramp going down. They have cars and truck going over, taking drugs. So here's the deal. We get the drugs, they get the money. These trucks get right over the ramp, over the wall. They can't do that when the wall is higher the ceiling. Or it's a long way down if they miss the ramp, I'll tell you. It's a long way. And I don't blame if people can get away with this stuff; let them get away with it. But we are going to make our country so strong and so beautiful, we going do it. So then, I put on something in on policy with regard to the Second Amendment. I'm a big Second Amendment person. And I -- we've all seen it. And in two weeks, this is something that I've really got to know a lot about; we are going take care of our vets. I'm going to put in a policy paper on the veterans and the veterans administration. And I know what to do. These guys -- it's not even the money. We spend so much money, but we have all thieves, tremendous corruption. A few weeks ago, on Wednesday, we had the longest wait in the history of the veteran's administration. They were in the waiting room. They waited days to see a doctor, they are dying. You saw that, you saw the reports, hard to believe. So many people are dying while they are waiting. They are dying. Things that could be taken care of with a pill, with -- a couple of visits, with maybe one visit and they are dying. It's not going to happen anymore. It is not going happen anymore. So that's what I really look forward to and that one is going to be -- and I'll tell you just briefly, I mean, it is common sense. When they are waiting too long, they going to go to a private doctor, private hospital, public hospital, whatever the hell is in the city, we are going to pay the bill, and then we're going to take care of these people, OK? We're going to take care of them. So -- and it's so important to me because some of the greatest people -- I've met some of the greatest people I've met on this trail. We called it -- do you believe I'm a politician? I can't believe it. I'm so embarrassed. People say, You're a politician\" and I say But I guess it a certain well, I am for a little while, and hopefully it works out, and we're going just do something that's going to be wonderful, and you are going be very happy. So, good, go ahead, you can go ahead. You know, it's funny. A few weeks ago, I got a great story and they said, he's a great speaker And I said, you know -- but you know why? Because I'm so excited to tell you about the next thing So I appreciate it the article, and the guy is right actually, but although I don't know, who knows? So what I did is we came up with a really great tax plan that has been really praised, and some cases not, they said it's too big. It's too big, we've got to put our country back to work. We have the highest taxes in the entire world, highest in the world. Our corporations are leaving our country because the taxes are too high. And they did a very sophisticated, very beautifully detailed policy paper. Now, a lot of the press would say, prior to that especially, and the Second Amendment and frankly, immigration, they said, oh. He talks well, but he doesn't talk -- You know I went to great schools. I'm like a smart person. It's like, oh, he doesn't talk details. So all of a sudden, I'm speaking details and even if they don't like the details, they appreciate it that I gave them the details. I will tell you, the tax plan is, I think, -- really something we are proud of. And I'm going to go over just quickly because most of you have heard it, but it's going to help you. It's going to help with a lot of ways. Number one, is it's going help with jobs. It's going help with jobs, it's going put people to work. We are taking jobs back. We are going to have -- we are going to have companies now, come back into our country. We are going to have a lower tax rate than China. We are going have a lower tax rate than many of these countries. You know what corporate inversion is? Corporate inversion is a disaster. Companies have billions, trillions, at least, 2 1/2 trillion total, outside of the country. Everybody agrees the money should be allowed to come back in. Republicans, democrats, this have been going on for years, they still can't agree. They agree, but can't come to a conclusion. And, if we bring that 2 1/2 trillion -- and I'll tell you what a bigger number than that, and if it is, my plan is even better. But I'm letting it come in for a very reasonable price, meaning, a very reasonable tax. Right now the tax is so high, you can't bring it. If anybody was running one of those companies, you can't get it in. They work on paperwork and they can't get it in. Smart, they have the greatest lawyers, they can't get the money in. So I'm going to simplify it. I want the money to come in so that these companies -- number one, don't go. You know what they do, a lot of them leave, you know this, in order to get the money. They actually move their company to Ireland, to other places in Europe, to other places in the world in order to get the money. And you have some big incredible companies, big named companies that are now thinking of leaving the United States, to get the money, and to get lower taxes. And there's really no way you can stop that. You can't say it is illegal because they'll find their way around it. The only thing that stops it is the marketplace. The marketplace is going stop it. So we are going to take care of that, but we have an -- I sort of titled it tax reform that will make America great again. Today, they said it's very Reagan-esque. I consider that a great compliment -- one of the writers, one of the writers said that. And -- thank you. And I start off, too few Americans are working, too many jobs are being shipped overseas, and too many middle income families just cannot make ends meet. We all know it. And if it is not you, you know people where that's the case. My plan directly meets these challenges, and the challenges also of business. We are going make our business strong again. We're going to make them competitive again. And by the way, nothing to do with this, but we're going to get rid of the regulations that are the mounting up like on a daily basis it's ridiculous. Regulations are going to go to wayside. There will be some, but they will be meaningful. They won't be the nonsense that every single day is happening, every single day. The plan will provide major tax relief for middle income and most other Americans, major tax relief. It will totally simplify the tax code. We'll grow the American economy and all of this will add up to a point where we're not going to be increasing our debt. If anything, if it really kicks in like I think it might, where the economy grows, we'll start reducing our debt, and reducing it big league, which I want to do. And again, it's -- I know the people I'm running against; and I know democrats and republicans. They can't do this, folks. I'm really good at it. Who's better at that than I am? Who's better? Is there anybody? I've had borrowing so big and I worked out perfectly to companies bigger, better, stronger than ever before, that's what you need. You need somebody with whatever the hell that is, whatever that craziness is up there, you need that. You need that. You can't just be a politician, all talk, no action, they talk. They wouldn't know what to do with China. Carl Icahn, great entrepreneur, everybody knows Carl Icahn. He came out. Yesterday, he said, Trump is the only one that knows what he's talking about.\" And he's great. And I'll get him involved.\"\"ou can't just be a politician I'll say, Carl That will go away very rapidly, and we'll get along. China doesn't even like us. You know these countries, they rip us up. They don't even like us. With me, I'll stop the rip off and they'll like us, can you believe it? Hard to believe, but that's what will happen. So in the plan, we're going to cut the individual rates from -- and this is very important. Number one, we're cutting down from seven brackets to four, and the rates are going from; 25, to 20, to 10, and to zero. When somebody's not making enough to live, what's the purpose of them doing lengthy returns, going to get help from H&R block, who we intend to put out of business because it's so ridiculous, so ridiculous. In order to pay us what -- I mean, these people need help. They're not doing well. So what's the purpose? Plus, the bookkeeping, it will be a tremendous percentage, but in many -- and some are not paying now anyway, but they have to go through this process, it's brutal. So we're going to simplify, but think of it, 25 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent, and it's -- that's a major reduction. And some people say it's too big a reduction, some of the great geniuses that haven't made a dollar in their life; not a dollar. They haven't created one job -- well What's the purpose? What is the purpose? We eliminate the marriage penalty, which is a killer for so many people, a killer. What's the purpose of that? And by the way, everyone agrees and they can't get it done. We eliminate the AMT, which is the Alternative Minimum tax, we eliminate it. We end the death tax. It's a double taxation. It's a double taxation. I mean a lot of you, as an example, in New Hampshire. You have a store, you have a little building, you have something -- you leave it to your kids, the kids get a tax bill where they have to pay 35 and even 50 percent estate taxes. Now, they mortgage up the business, the bank ends up taking it over because they have to pay the estate taxes, and you've been paying taxes all the while. It's double taxation and it has to end. So many businesses have been destroyed by the death tax or the estate tax, as people like to call it, but so many businesses. That's very important. Our plan reduces and/or totally eliminates most of the deductions and repos available to special interests. Who, by the way, are supporting Bush and Rubio and most of them; and Hillary, big league Hillary, big league Bush. You know, Bush is going to spend $100 million on ads. That money comes from friends of mine. Their friends, I know most -- some are enemies. Some of them I don't like. Actually, many of them I don't like, but... But, when you see an ad, every time you see an ad from Rubio, or Bush, or Hillary, remember, that money is coming from special interests and lobbyists. And when they want something done, in a year from now, two years from now, if they ever get in, it would be sad, won't that be sad? If Trump doesn't make it, won't that be a terrible thing? But when that money gets spent on, you know, millions, $25 million -- Jeb today, put in an order, I hear, $25 million for ads. Well, what do you do when you're weak on immigration and you're in favor of common corps, how do you solve that problem with ads? I don't think you solve it. Rubio, the same thing, he's very, very, very weak on immigration. A member of the gang of eight, totally weak on immigration. How do you solve a problem, when you say people can just pour in? Made a speech not so long ago, in Spanish, saying, he wants to open up the borders essentially.\" He didn't want you people hearing it. So he made the speech in Spanish. \"\"ubio That's true. But he's very weak on illegal immigration. And I don't think -- I'm not sure, I may be wrong, but whether you're Rubio or Bush -- I have to tell you one story, do you mind? So Bush is the mentor of Rubio. And everybody said, this is politics at its lowest and worst -- I can't stand these politicians, right? So Bush is the mentor. And he goes out and he says, yes So everyone said, Rubio will never run\" The great genius pundits He was very young. He runs. And they ask Bush, What do you think of Rubio?\" Rubio comes out and he's talking about Bush and you know. \"What do you think of Rubio?\" \"He's my dear friend. He's so wonderful. I love him so much.\"\"\"e was very young. He runs. And they ask Bush Then there's Rubio, who's running against Bush, and he's -- you know probably shouldn't be from a loyalty standpoint. The veterans know what I mean about loyalty, right? Right? Right? So they ask Rubio, What do you think of Bush?\" \"Oh They hate so much. They hate more than anybody in this room hates their neighbor, any. But it's political bullshit, do you understand? It's true. It's true. So, let's go. So we're going to reduce or eliminate most of the deductions, loopholes available to special interests and the very rich. Me? I don't like that. Maybe I'll change my mind on that one, I don't know, going to cost me a lot. While preserving charitable giving, which is important, and giving mortgage interest deductions -- we want to leave the mortgage interest. You know, a couple of the plans -- yeah, you got to have it. You know, a lot of people were worried about real estate. Try taking the mortgage interest deduction out, you'll see what's going to happen to real estate. You want to see a crash? Try that one. So we end the current tax treatment of carried interest. It's a little complicated stuff, but the business folks know what that means. For speculative partnerships, that do not grow businesses or create jobs and they're not risking their own capital. That's what happens, they get this big thing, they're not risking their own capital, and it's a big number. Somebody said it's not so big.\" It's a big number And a lot of the hedge fund guys, they are not happy with me right now, but they're nice. But they didn't give me anything, they want to. You know as soon as you go to number one, that puts amazing how many guys call up Don I don't want it. Am I making a mistake? I feel sort of like it's like -- it's not natural to me. I'm turning down a lot of money, believe me. I hope it's appreciated someday. No, honestly. No, honestly. Because, if I turn down tens of millions of dollars and I lose, I will feel so stupid, really. So it didn't matter. So I hope it's appreciated. No business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a Mom and Pop Shop, how many people own a shop? Raise your hand, great business, right? OK? Were you in the same category now because the taxes are too high, is that right? So no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a Mom and Pop Shop, to a freelancer, you have a lot of them up in New Hampshire. Freelancers, plenty of freelancers, living from gig to gig, will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. We're not going to take all the money away anymore. And people aren't going to create jobs if you do that. So we're going to have jobs, this is a job creator. This is real. This will be really dynamic. This will be something special. Now a lot of people that don't know, they don't get it, but many people that do really get it. A one-time deemed repatriation, that's what I was talking about, all the money coming back in, of the corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted rate of 10 percent. In other words, we're going to tax them 10 percent. They're going to have the money in our country, instead of having it overseas. Tax rate of 10 percent, and ends to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. So that, what you're going to do is, you're going to have tremendous incentives for people even if they're doing business abroad, but you're going to bring the money back in to the United States. And they're going to put the money back to work, even if they just give it out in dividends because the people getting the dividends, they're going to spend the money. And you're talking about trillions of dollars are over there. Trillions of dollars, and believe me, mark my words. I told you before, they say, it is $2.5 trillion So corporate inversion, we're going to stop, and we're going to have companies not leave. In the old days, people would leave New York and they'd go to Florida or they'd leave New Jersey, they'd go to Texas, where the taxes are lower. Now they leave the United States and they go to Ireland and they go to other countries where they have lower tax rates and other things. But with what I'm doing, they're not going to be leaving anymore. And we don't have to say, boom, you're staying. They're not going to leave anymore. So it really works. What we want to do now is reduce or eliminate many of the business loopholes because we're lowering their taxes so much, that we can get rid of these tremendously complicated loopholes. And in the end, the business taxes are going to be lower than they were before substantially, but you're not going to have accountants, where you have tax returns that go up through the ceiling, if you have a business. It's going be simple. It's going be less taxes and it's going be simple. So we're going to be in a position to do some amazing things. And I've gotten just so many people are so thrilled with what I said about taxes. And I thought I'd review it for you. I did this the other day at Trump tower, and we had a great turnout. And as I said, we had just amazing response. So let's talk a little bit about ISIS and let's talk about our country. We spent -- thank you. We spent so much money, so much money in the Middle East, just spent trillions. Just in Iraq, $2 trillion. Just in Iraq. Not to mention, even more importantly, the lives and the wounded warriors who I love, who I love. These are the greatest of all. We don't take care of them properly, but these are the greatest of them all, the wounded warriors. So we have a president who doesn't know what he's doing. We have a president who looked like -- remember, he said they were the JV, that ISIS was the JV? Well, he looked like the JV last week, when you compared him to Putin in New York, the JV. So now we have Putin, said, I'm going into Syria. And I'm going to knock the hell out of ISIS.\" He said. And I'm saying The problem we have is we have a president who is not respected by Putin, just not respected. He leaves New York, leaves the United Nations, couple of days later, he's got massive amounts of artillery and planes and everything else. all very quickly done. We would never act like that --we would never act like that. I saw one of your generals. I won't mention his name, one of your top generals the other day, active. They said, What do you do about ISIS Do you think he would say that? I don't know? He'd smacked the reporter in the face, kick him in the lips --he would give a smack to that guy. Or General Douglas Macarthur. The highest marks in the -- I'm a big person for academia, I believe in it. The highest marks in the history of west point; General Macarthur, a great general. Can you imagine him saying, I don't know what we do about\" -- these guys know But we have people that don't know. Either they don't know or they're being so constrained by politics that they're afraid to say. But we have to be tough and we have to be smart. At the same time, I want to rebuild this country. We have bridges that are falling down. We have 60 percent of our bridges are in danger, 60 percent. We have roadways that are coming apart. We have airports that are third world. You go over to Qatar, you go over to Saudi Arabia, you go over to some of these countries, China. You see airports the likes of which you have never, ever seen before. Then you come back and you land at Laguardia. It's true. Pot holes, pot holes. You land at Laguardia or Newark or L.A.X. and you walk into a filthy terminal that's falling apart with broken terrazzo floors, and that's what we have. We used to be the leader. We have to rebuild our own country. And you know, when you owe $19 trillion and you want to take care of the vets and you want to build up the military because I will build up the military so big, so strong. Nobody's going to mess with us, nobody, nobody. Now, with that being said, but you have to know when to use it. You have to know when, right? I mean, you have to know when. So in 2004 and 2003, I said, don't go into Iraq.\" I didn't know that much about Iraq So I said, I don't know if they have weapons of mass destruction That was in Reuters 2004, in June or July, a big story, Trump opposed to doing it.\" Now I said, but why are we going after Iraq right now?\" The families went back to Saudi Arabia. They didn't go back to Iraq. I think one might have But I said, you're going to destabilize the Middle East.\" So here's what happens Their oil is unbelievable in Iraq, underground, one of the biggest in the world. So they totally take over and they're going to very soon, so we spend all this money, all these lives, all these wounded warriors, we get nothing. We got nothing because we have stupid leadership. Now, if you know anything about the Soviet Union, if you want the real truth, the Soviet Union broke up because they spent so much money in Afghanistan, OK? They spent so much money that they were going bust and that's the primary reason or certainly one of the primary reasons that the Soviet Union broke up. The Afghanistanian people, great fighters, always have been known. I have a friend of mine, he's a big war historian, among the best fighters, Afghanistan. So the Soviet Union -- so now, we have the Soviet Union wants to go to Syria, and they want to knock the hell out of people. And we're fighting Assad because Assad is our enemy, and we're fighting Syria. Now Syria wants to fight Assad. Think of this, just put it together. You know, a lot of people -- I get a little credit, they say, oh I guarantee you that Assad is sitting back saying, that president is one of the dumbest human beings on earth.\" It's true. \"\" guarantee you that Assad is sitting back saying So you have ISIS that wants to fight Assad and ISIS can't because we're bombing them. We're not doing the job, but we're certainly, you know, hurting them. So they're not going after Assad. Now, you have Russia and Iran. Now, Iran became powerful because we gave them so much money, aside from the nuclear, which they will have, believe me. But we gave them $150 billion. So now they're feeling, there are going to be terrorists all over the world, they have so much money. And to them $150 billion, that's real money, with us, not the same. So now you have Iran and you have Russia on the side of Assad, but they both want -- Russia does want ISIS out because they don't want them coming into Russia. They don't want them crossing borders and they don't want them coming into Russia. Y You have the migration because Syria's such a disaster. And now I hear we want to take in 200,000 Syrians, right? And they could be -- listen, they could be ISIS. I don't know. Did you ever see a migration like that? They're all men, and they're all strong-looking guys. Did you see it? They're walking and there are so many men, there aren't that many women. And I'm saying to myself, why aren't they fighting to save Syria? Why are they migrating all over Europe? It's a serious thing. So now, now you have this guy, Secretary Kerry, may be the worst negotiator. I think he will go down as the worst secretary of state than Hillary Clinton because of the deal. And she was terrible, but I think he's going to go down as worse because of this deal. So now you have him saying, we're going to take in maybe\"-- I mean We have no idea. There's no identification, there's no anything. And I'll tell you right now, I'm putting everybody on notice, and hopefully this gets outside of this room and I guess it will with all these crazy cameras going back there. I'm putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria, as part of this mass migration, that if I win, if I win, they're going back. They're going back. I'm telling you. They're going back. Because you know, military tactics are very interesting. This could be one of the great tactical ploys of all time, 200,000-man army, maybe, or if you said 50,000 or 80,000 or 100,000, we got problems. And that could be possible. I don't know that it is, but it could be possible. So they're going back. They're going back. I'm just telling them. So if they come, that's great. And if I lose, I guess they're staying. But if I win, they're going back. And I know a lot of people are saying, well So tonight, I'm doing a show on CNN at 10 o'clock, and the question was asked to me, why don't you give us policy It sounds terrible. I really know a lot about it. I think, I think my biggest -- I think other than jobs, everybody says. You know, CNN did a poll. I'm through the roof on jobs, through the roof on leadership. Through the roof on almost everything other than some people don't think I'm a nice person, I'm still low on that. But you know, ultimately -- I am a nice person, I love people. I want to help people. But you know -- thank you. You know... Actually, you know where I do my best favorables in New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina because they got to know me. I'm here so much. Those are the places. So once I get out, I think people will find that. You know what I just want to do the right thing. And I tell the story about a woman who said, do you think you're nice enough to be...?\" I said I had an article about, not so long ago, a business article. And I beat some group of people -- I love winning. I love it. And I beat this group for something that everybody wanted, I just beat them, and it turned out to be great. And one of my opponents, not in a bad way, but in a very respectful way, said, you know And so does Patton and so do MacArthur, and so as anybody that's smart. So when they ask me about, like what I want to do with Syria?\" I know what I want to do And maybe if you're unpredictable, the stupid people are going to say, Oh Remember, when they were handing $50 million of cash, cash. They were going through Afghanistan paying off -- I want to know who are the soldiers that are carrying cash of $50 million -- cash. How stupid are we? I wouldn't be surprised -- if those soldiers, I wouldn't be that surprised if the cash didn't get there, I have to be honest. But, remember when Obama was saying, We will leave. We are leaving Iraq as of a certain date.\" Now the opponents said What do we have to fight anymore for? Let's just wait a year and a half. That's what happened. And then as soon as we left, they knocked the shit out of everybody, right? They just knocked the hell out of everybody. Obama, this great president of ours, we will leave. Remember, he gave a certain date, a date certain, we will be out. And these tough guys, these are tough fighters, especially, when they have something they want to fight for. They didn't want to fight for a corrupt government, but he gave a certain date. So I want to be unpredictable, OK? I would never have given a date. I might have said we're going to stay there for 20 years. We're going to stay there for eternity. And these other guys would say, Oh I mean, look. We shouldn't have been there, but we were doing OK toward the end, and then we took everybody out. But instead, if you would have said, No Don't we want that as a thing, right? So I love the people of New Hampshire. I love you. I love the people of this country and I didn't really want to do this. I did something -- I have this -- people actually thought I wouldn't run because it say -- what, why would he do this? It's hard, nasty. The press is horrible, even not all of it, but horrible. The -- you know it's hard. And they say, Why would you do it?\" I do it because we have a chance to make this country greater than it's ever been before. I really believe that. \"\"he press is horrible And if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. The one thing I will warn you about, I don't think we can go on like this much longer. I really don't. I think this election is so important, beyond important, because we cannot continue to go on like we're going on right now. We need a real leader. We want somebody that loves the country. Truly loves the country, truly wants to make it work... And I can promise you this. I can promise you this. If I get elected president, we will indeed make America great again, that I can tell you. That I can tell you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much, everybody. We love you all. Thank you. Thank you."}
