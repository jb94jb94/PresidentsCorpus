Thank you. What a crowd wow! Thank you. Thank you, Tucson. Thank you very much. You son, I'm thrilled to be in Arizona with the thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Fifteen days from now we're going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win four more years in that beautiful White House.","Everybody needs to get out and vote return, your absentee ballot, or vert. You know you can go out there. I think today, when do you do it today tomorrow, whatever you can go and vote today, they say today go out and vote that beats a ballot. Do you agree that beats a ballot? Remember the old fashioned days when you'd actually go out and vote today.","They send you millions of ballots. Are you okay? Over there, everyone fine, good? Ok, he looks better than I do that guy he looks better than I do good. Thank you. You make sure you're. Ok with your vote will continue to cut your taxes and regulations. Maintain energy independence, which we have now strengthened our military support, our police protect our Second Amendment.","I don't see you people, I don't think you're going to want to give up those guns. I don't think so. That's not that's that for Arizona, defend our borders, arrest, violent criminals, and confirm more judges to uphold the rule of law. Under my leadership, prosperity will surge. What we've done in the last three and a half years has been incredible.","Nobody's ever done what we've done. There is no administration, that's accomplished what we've accomplished in the first three and a half years, not even optimism will boom the pandemic. It's rounding, the turn vaccines are coming and I look, fine Donna. You know and we'll get back to a normal life. That's what we want just a normal just seven months ago.","We want to get back. It will be better than that very soon we built a foundation. That's so strong and you see what's happening stock market through the roof you for one case through the roof, your stock through the roof, your housing through the roof. Everything is good, your optimism, and what about 56 percent of the people?","Just a Gallup poll just came out. Fifty-six percent of the people say they're better off today than they were four years ago and we have a pandemic, and next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. That's what's going to happen. We're cutting your taxes, they're, raising your taxes, that's an easy one.","To figure out is it this election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden depression. If he even gets to run it's a choice between getting a safe vaccine and getting back in and working and by the way you have a governor here today, he's done a great job and he's kept. You open your open, unlike some of them like Michigan.","You know we won the case in Michigan, you know the only one that was allowed to have a good time was the governor's husband he was allowed to do whatever the hell he wanted, but nobody else they would like in a prison, but we're going to have A safe vaccine and Biden you know he's going to do lock them down, let's lock everybody down, but we built the greatest economy.","Ever we had to close it down. We saved millions of lives. By doing what we did, then we built it back up and now we're doing record type numbers and it's a choice between the American dream or a socialist nightmare. That's what it is Biden will delay therapies, postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools and shut down our country and we're opening and we're opening rapidly and we've got a V shape.","It may be a super-V. It looks like it's a super-V which nobody ever even heard of before he will massively raise your taxes. Bury your rag. You will be buried in regulations. You know we cut regulations, it would take 18 to 21 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to one year and you know what from two to one we're very shortly to be exact right now, it's listed to have it down to one year and it may get rejected for environmental reasons or safety, and that's OK, probably not, but that's. Ok, but you know what you're going to have it approved or not approved, and it's a one year process, not a 21-year process, and this is going on all over the country and in my opinion, what we've done and regulations is even more important than the Biggest tax cut in the history of our country, I think it's immoral and they're going to bring all those regulations back.","They want to dismantle your police department's. Dissolve your borders, dissolve your borders. If you don't have borders, you don't have a country confiscate your guns, ban. American energy wipe out private health care hundred and eighty million people terminate religious liberty. This is for the women, the women who live in the suburbs.","They want to destroy your suburbs and I ended the rule that was going to destroy. I ended the regulation that was going to this. I kept hearing that women from the suburbs won't like Trump. I said Why? Because I'm stopping crime you're going to have the suburbs, be safe suburbs, you're, having safe suburbs and you're not going to have low-income housing projects built next to your house, we ended the regulation that would have destroyed your suburbs.","It's amazing how the women like all of a sudden and, as you know, the Democrats, they want to cut our military to the bone and we built the greatest military right now in the history of our country. Frankly, in the history of the world, Biden will surrender your jobs to China. He will surrender your future to the virus and he will surrender your country to the radical socialist left and you see that happening.","The only thing Biden wants to do is get as much as he can for himself. Have you been watching this whole thing play out? I didn't know anything about it. Oh, here's a picture Biden playing golf with his mom. I didn't know my son was taking money from the receiver. I didn't know my son got $3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow, his wife.","I wonder why and then you see all the things right that we have to give the man 10 percent. We have to give the man 10 percent right boy I'll, tell you nobody's ever seen in the media right and big tech. They won't, they won't allow it. Charlie Kirk, you know Charlie Kirk, great guy, they shut down his site because he mentioned it.","Look he's a corrupt politician. This guy he's a corrupt politician to get the power by this made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination. He has handed control of his party over to the socialists, the communists, the Marxists, and the left-wing extremist and that's before we get to his own personal corruption, which is more than anybody in history.","I say this: it's the second biggest scandal politically in the history of our country. No one was spying on my campaign and getting caught Biden even chose as his running mate. The most liberal senator in America, Kamala Kamala senator Kamala Harris, is a sponsor of the Socialist Green New Deal and legislation to strip away the private health plans of 180 million Americans, and you know her and Bernie Sanders want to do something in Arizona.","They have some deal in Arizona where your taxes are going to go way up. You know that right, your governor who's right over here, your great governor, is saying he's not happy with it, but Bernie Sanders the second most liberal person. You know she's first-rate she's conservative. They want to raise your taxes, eight and a half percent.","So I'm glad governor he's saying more, it's probably more. What is the name of that governor rule? What right you know about it? Ok, you can't have a mint because they control Biden, 100 percent Biden, a shot. You know he shot right. He's Gonzo harris also urged his supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out the riot as the ones that knocked out your towns.","You cities not in Republican areas, by the way, all in Democrat areas, you look at Portland that we wouldn't take in 15 minutes. We could have solved that we told the governor Democrat. Let us in we'll solve that problem. We went into Minneapolis. It took us a half an hour that was over with, unfortunately, they could have called a little earlier and in Seattle, they gave up when they heard we were going in the next morning, but we would just look all Democrat areas New York going to hell.","I feel so sad with New York. Crime is up 250 percent, Cuomo. A terrible thing has happened in New York. Look at Chicago Democrat again: crime is through the roof that a weekend eighty-seven people were shot and 16 died. Okay, now do you believe this isn't a war in Afghanistan?","You don't lose. Many people were coming out by the way. It's all coming, we're all coming back home, but you go to war zones, you don't have that and we could solve it so easily. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You know, there's never been that chance before seriously. We all like Ronald Reagan, I guess he'd be, but he never had that share.","We love you think of it. We love you you're, going to make me cry, don't do that. I don't want to cry, I don't want to cry, make me cry, you'll destroy my image, and then you love me and he won't ever be there. I appreciate it now. I do and I feel the same way. That's why I'm doing this. I had a good life before I did this stuff.","Believe me, my life was very simple and very nice. The Democrat Party's Warren Copps is inciting riots and putting police officers and American families in very grave danger. Unlike Joe Biden, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement and I was endorsed by almost every law enforcement group in the United States, including New York's, finest and Chicago and Florida and Texas and Oklahoma and every place, and I was just named.","I have to say this happened today, the man of the year in that big magazine, The Blue magazine good day for man of the year. So I just tell you that, for whatever reason I take, I'm the only one standing between you and a left-wing crusade. You know you have people, they want to change our whole country, and the thing that's going to bring us back together is success because I'll tell you we were ready.","I was getting calls seven months ago we had the best employment numbers we ever had with the greatest success we've ever had. We were beating China at everything. You know you kept hearing about it, we were beating everybody and they were calling me people that I wouldn't be speaking to generally. Let's get together, it was happening and then we got hit by the China plague and then we had to start all over again, but it will success brings us together.","I saw it and we saw it for two months. It was really going on a new study of the Biden. Harris agenda found that their plans will crater the typical American family by more than six thousand five hundred dollars, they're horrible horrible plans to finance what the blue the new Green Deal. The Green New Deal is the craziest thing right: no, more airplanes, no more double cars, no more cows.","If you have a ranch, you won't have cows anymore, no more! You you'll be next. In just three years. I increase family income by six thousand dollars and we're not even talking about the energy. Did you ever think you'd be seeing two-dollar gasoline again and you got that and it's plentiful and we saved all our energy jobs.","All of our energy jobs, we said Biden will eviscerate the middle class. My policies will lift the middle class to record highs and that's where we're going very quickly. For the last forty-seven years, sleepy Joe Biden has shipped away your jobs shut down. Your factories threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries.","You've, never even heard of Joe Biden is a servant of the left-wing globalists and lobbyists the wealthy donors, the Washington vultures, who got rich bleeding America dry. You know they raised a lot of money. The Democrats, you know why, because they make deals they make deals. I would be the greatest fundraiser in history.","If I wanted to call Wall Street normal, I want $10 million for my campaign. Yes, sir, all I have to say is: I want 10 million. I want 15, I want 25. I would set every record, but you know what happens when you do that: you're selling yourself out when you have to do something. You can't do it anymore, because you feel guilty, you see them setting all sorts of records.","I know with the records. Are the records every time they set a record? They gave away everything in 2016. You voted to fire, this corrupt and decrepit political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first, it's about time. Joe Biden is always and always has been a corrupt politician.","Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and you know what you knew that and a lot of people knew it for a long time. But now you have the laptop it's over and as far as I'm concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise and that's what it is. A criminal enterprise, smoking gun e-mails showed we just found them.","You saw that. Did you see a shifty shift? We think that the laptop was made by Russia. Oh, I see. Oh, he just said it was made by Russia. Here we go again: Russia did it: Russia, Russia, Russia. You know the head of DNI John Ratcliffe was fantastic, came out and said that was false information. Now, these are bad people.","These are sick people, you notice, they never say it was made by China because they're all on the take smoking gun e-mails show just came out that the Biden family used the vice presidency as a for-profit cash machine and that Joe Biden has been lying to The American public to cover it up, remember, he said, No, I never met anybody from Paris knows it is in Paris, but actually that I understand because he's got no memory left.","Its guns is in Paris right. No, I don't read, and then they show a picture of him playing golf with the head of charisma boy. Oh boy, if Biden wins China wins and China will own the USA. Remember what I said: the media and big tech is trying to hide the entire scandal. You believe what they're doing they're taking people like Charlie, Kirk, and others off if they even mention that Biden is corrupt and they know he's corrupt, but he's -- they're, corrupt, he's so perfect for them he's their corrupt because they know that publicizing.","These revelations would mean an end of Biden's presidential run. I think it's an end right now. Look, you know, I think it's an end right now how the hell did you do when you see the kind of things that they do where the big guy has to get at least 10 percent, the big guy I wouldn't know who the big guy is.","I wonder when you see what, if you put him as president, you should be ashamed of yourselves. You want to know that I'm not just running against Biden, I'm running against the left-wing media, the big tech giants, and the Washington swamp and I've been running against it from the, and here I am all by myself.","It's fearless anybody else. There would have been in a corner right now, thumb in mouth, saying: Mommy, take me home Mommy. I want to go nowadays. It's great. You know why it's great, though, because nobody's ever done well, we've done nobody. They flood your communities with criminal aliens, drugs, and crime.","While they live behind beautiful gated communities, they try to take away your guns while they enjoy private security is fully armed by the way. How fully armed? How about Bloomberg? We are fighting guns and he's got five guys around him with guns. They support crippling lockdowns, while their jobs and their industry remain totally exempt it's time to send a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites in Washington and in Silicon Valley show them.","The American people are in charge by delivering their chosen candidates sleepy Joe Biden, who shouldn't even be their candidate. He should have laws because Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren if she wanted dropped out the day before Super Tuesday Joe, would have lost every single state to crazy Bernie. It's a very simple business, but we have to show them the Democrats, a thundering defeat on November 3rd and if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician webster's. If I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment.","It's because I was elected to fight for you, hotter than anyone has ever fought for you and I'm fighting so hard. I had a great life, I'm fighting so hard because I love my country and because I'm determined to ensure that the forgotten men and women of this country are never forgotten again and they won't be.","And we taught that lesson to him four years ago. But we're going to teach him again because this is the most important you know I used to go few months ago to say: well I don't know this is important, that's important, which is more important. This is the most important election in the history of our country.","Divided agenda would be a catastrophe for Arizona seniors. Do we have any seniors in the House? Biden is pledging mass amnesty and free federal health care for illegal aliens? You saw that where he was up on the stage with his radical left Democrats, who is willing to give free health care to illegal immigrants right, they said to illegal immigrants right and everybody raised their hand and Biden couldn't get his up because he knew you know.","He's been doing this crap for 47 years right, he couldn't, he knew it was wrong, but then he looked at his brain and shot. So I looked over at him and their hands were all up there. He looked over there and their hands were all up there. A lot of them he knew it was wrong because it would be so horrible for our country because everyone's gonna flood, our country, you get free healthcare right.","You get free healthcare, you get free education, I jokingly said, and everybody gets a Rolls Royce and CNN said: that's a lie. So what happened? Is he couldn't get it up and then he looked and he left and he got it up and I said thank you. We just won the election, he would decimate Medicare if he did that, and it's not going to be up to him.","That's his party, that's what they want. They want socialized, medicine and he'll destroy your Social Security. While I'm president, no one will touch your Medicare or your Social Security. You know the amazing thing Biden is always complaining. Oh, he didn't stop China fast enough, except he didn't want to stop him at all.","You know little things like this, but you know he's always complaining, and yet he was here for 47 years right, I say, Joe Joe, it's not like you're an outsider, and it wasn't that long ago, either forty-seven years and all he does is complain. Biden said 47 years to fight for seniors and reduce prescription drug costs.","Look what I've done and I've just exercised they're going to come down. 70. 80. 90 percent, because I just did something that nobody thought anybody would do. A favorite nation's flaws would pay the lowest in the world. You'll see numbers that are shocking, they're, not happy with me. The Big Pharma Big Pharma is spending a lot of money.","When you see those ads, please remember every one of those ads means your drug prices are coming down. They can't believe I tried to make a deal with them. I did I tried, but we couldn't in the end we couldn't they got too greedy, too much money too much money, but you know. Last year we brought drug prices down 1 percent, I'm not bragging about it's the first time in 52 years that drug prices came down, but now we're going for the big one.","Now we're going for the big one and you know rebates. You know the richest people, the middlemen, you know the middleman about drugs. You know that we have middlemen, nobody knows who the hell. They are never hear middle women. I hear middlemen so we'll make it politically correct: middle men. No, they called middlemen.","Nobody knows who they are. These guys are so rich. Who are they I'll bet? You, Hunter, gets a piece of the action. Did it hunter Biden? Is a middle man on top of everything he gets it from China. He gets it from Ukraine. He got three and a half million from Russia from Moscow. He got three and a half and on top of everything else, he's a middle man now, but he is, he probably gets a piece of the action, but instead, he sells seniors out to the drug lobby and to big pharma.","That's Biden's senior, I'm taking on the powerful special interests like never before nobody's ever done this before nobody's ever done it before I mean you know, for years you heard about drug prices, nobody ever did anything and now you hear about drug prices and they drop and They're going to be dropping like a rock, also I'm letting your governor, your great governor, buy until the thing kicks in and probably litigation.","But you know I've exercised this whole thing with favorite nation. So if Germany pays 10 cents for a pill and we're paying two and a half dollars - and you have that kind of despair, it is ridiculous that we have the right to match. In other words, we get the lowest price, but until it kicks in Canada, pays half of what we pay.","So I'm letting your governor and other governors go to. Canada buy your drugs through Canada, save 50 percent. We get rid of the middleman. The other thing we did very big much less than what we're talking about, but very big. We capped insulin costs for medicine and Medicare for Medicare plans at less than thirty-five dollars a month.","People were dying because they couldn't afford insulin. 33 million seniors thirty-three. I think it is thirty-five dollars, but 33 million seniors on Medicare will soon be receiving two hundred dollars to help with their drug costs, on top of everything else nobody's done by the way. In all fairness, nobody has done anything like this, but your big thing, your big thing, is going to be when you see what happens with the favorite nations because you've been hearing about it for years where other countries are paying a tiny fraction of what we bear.","All of the cost, because our politicians sold us out, they sold us out, but I'm not a politician. So it's one of the I couldn't stand watching to battle the China virus. We launched the largest mobilization since World War. Two are early and aggressive action saved more than 2 million lives. I acted early to ban travel from China and Japan.","How about this? You should have done it sooner, but in the meantime, when I did it, he called me xenophobic right, and then months later he agreed that I was right and now he's saying I should have done it sooner this guy. I also banned it from Europe because I saw with Italy and with Spain and with France, and by the way, they have a big spike right now they have a very big spike right now and we're doing good.","We are rounding the turn we have the vaccines coming in all, but even without we're rounding the turn people are pandemic out. You know that they're pandemic out. That's why it's so great. Would you governors done he's, opened up your state you're doing great, we pioneered lives and by the way you get it.","You know, like I say here. I am I'm here, I'm here and now I'm immune. I can jump into this audience and kiss every man and woman I'm a it used to be you're immune for life, and then, when I got it I said I'm immune. They said it's only good for four months, see if anybody else you understand that right, I'll jump into that audience right.","We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced their fate, tally rate. Eighty-five percent - think of it, and I had it too. I didn't feel good. I feel that's so great and I'm not used to that, and we can't let that happen to a president, because we know we have to be at the top of our game. That's why you can't let Biden be president because he's not at the top of his game mentally can't. Have that one thing I can tell you Putin, President Xi of China Kim Jong-un, all of them macro they're very much at the top of their game.","You can't let this happen to our country, you can't, but I was it. I was laying, and you know if your president, one thing: you're guaranteed lots of doctors and they would grab me at a grab me by every part. They had hands or love music. Get the hell out of here, I just don't feel good and we ended up. I used the drug regeneration which nobody ever thought about six months ago and I woke up the next morning and I was like I felt like Superman get me out of here.","I said get me out of here and Eli Lilly makes a similar product and we're going to distribute that we're trying to get emergency use. So we can do it faster because it's early, but it's fantastic antibodies and we're going to distribute it all over and we're going to make sure that people that have a problem they get the same drug as I got, and I'm telling you it'll be the same result, it'll be the same result and it's free we're going to do it.","Three companies are working with us because it's not their fault, it's China's fault, it's not their fault, but I woke up and I felt good I said, get me out of here boom Superman through Operation warp speed. We will have one hundred million vaccine doses before the end of the year and our military is going to distribute them and they are there's nobody like our military.","The vaccine will end the pandemic, but even without the vaccine, the pandemic is ending, it's got and it ends with it. But you know this: can this can go quickly? This can make it go a lot faster. Biden's, lockdown will crush America. My plan will crush the virus and bring back your American dream, so we're joined today by some very special people, a friend of mine, somebody, that's been with me from the beginning.","I've been with him from the beginning, he's very difficult because when he needs something for the state like money, he'll call me all the time I say, Doug. Do me a favor. Give me a break, but I guess that's what you're supposed to do right? That's what you want he's supposed to call, and finally, I say all right: Doug you got to get out.","You promise not to call the no call me two weeks later. I need more, but he's a great governor. One of the greatest governors he's done a fantastic job, you're down to very low numbers by the way Doug do see Doug please, and we want you to vote for Martha McSally save your Second Amendment. Save your Second Amendment.","Doug. You want to come up. Come up. Doug come in for a second come on Doug I'll, tell you this guy has been a great guy. I don't know if you like him or not. Ok, he's been a great.","Donald Trump will win. Arizona, Donald Trump will be reelected, president of the United States, and, along with Donald Trump and Mike Pence, Martha McSally on November 3rd will join them in the U.S. senate.","Mr. President, because of your policies, Arizona's economy is booming. Our home values are rising faster than anywhere else in the nation, and Amy Coney Barrett will be confirmed to the Supreme Court. Do you, Joe Biden is wrong for America, Joe Biden would lock us down. Joe Biden would reduce your income.","Sixty-five hundred dollars and Joe Biden would make Washington D.C a state and how many presidents, the United States, would protect Arizona by talking about what Bernie Sanders wants to do here by endorsing Prop 2 0 8 wanting to raise our taxes. Seventy-seven percent. So, on November, 3rd vote no on Prop 208. And vote yes for Donald Trump and Mike Pence to go back to the White House.","","Thank you. He's a great governor he's a great -- great governor. What a job he's done - and you know what we're not going to take her time or anything but Martha McSally - is here: she's saving your Second Amendment, she's, been a great -- great Senator Martha, come here, she's been a great -- great senator and just go out and vote For Martha, McSally save your Second Amendment.","Save me second amendment. Thank you I'll see you thank you. Darling, she's done a great job and she's a work she's a great fighter pilot. He told me all about her some of the pilots. They said she was a great fighter pilot, so thank you, Martha. Thank you. Thank you. Doug. We also have a congressional candidate that they say is a star in the making.","I've heard it from a lot of people. Vote for Brandon Mark was Brandon Brandon. Good luck! Man, I hear it's going good. Thank you, Brandon Brandon Martin. Thank you, Brandon you're, going to do great. I heard you're doing really well. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we're doing it again.","You know it's make America great again right, I say Make America Great Again again again again, we did it and now we had to do it again. It's all right. It's happening and it's happening. Much faster looks like a super-V in my first three years. We increased family income more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration.","I think it is five times more in the first three years, five times more than eight years of the Obama Biden administration, that's not even believable African-American unemployment, Hispanic, American unemployment, Asian American unemployment, all reached record lows, the lowest in the history of our country.","We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. That's a record and I'm doing very well in the polls with Hispanic Americans. But I always like you - and you always like me to fake news. Just didn't know that our policies are lifting up all Americans of every income since the China virus we created eleven point four million American jobs.","It's a record to nobody's ever seen. Anything like you know the unemployment rate. Normally, I wouldn't be happy about this right, but the unemployment rate a week ago hit 7.8 percent. Think of that now we were hearing 42. It's going to go to 42, it's going to go to 44, it's going to go to thirty! Eight seven point eight percent and heading this way.","Think of that, would you believe that no, I wouldn't say it because we were at 3.4, 3.5, and heading even better than that, but that's OK, we'll be there soon after the virus left China. We experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western country and the fastest recovery anywhere in the world from an economy standpoint and we've already cut the unemployment rate in less than half that's a fantastic thing under Biden and Obama took over three and a half years for Arizona to regain 60 percent of the jobs lost in the crisis, and we've done it in four months.","Take it that it wasn't our fault, it wasn't. Our fault. Manufacturing production is up, 61 percent retail sales are up. Scuse me one hundred and twenty-one percent. That means more than free for the pandemic and automobile production nobody's going to believe this one is up three hundred and fifty percent since April lows, three hundred and fifty percent.","I have a way that we can stop it elect sleepy Joe. No, no you for who has a 4 or 1 k. Ok! So if I tell you that you, for one case and you're, all at record highs are very close right. If I told you that you for one case will be cut in half and much worse than that, that's what's going to happen! You're going to end up in a depression with this guy he's going to raise your taxes by four or five times and they're going to put on regulations.","Every company is going to say, let's get out of here because I'll tell you that the regulation cuts which are more than anybody than any administration's ever done. The regulation cuts in their own way were more important than the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. Thank you. As President, I've been delivering for our incredible Hispanic American community like nobody's done before, and I'm fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, and Hispanic owned.","Small businesses, Joe Biden, would wipe out your small businesses with lockdowns and regulations. You know he said the other day. Oh, I'd, lock it down. Oh great, that's thanks a lot, Joe. We appreciate and devastate your families with massive tax hikes. He will wage war on Catholic organizations, banned charter, schools fund, extreme late-term, abortion and he'll.","Let socialists run wild and we will never have a socialist country. We will never have it, we can't we won't have a cut. That's why we're going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote this November get out and vote get out and vote for decades. Our politicians spent trillions of dollars, rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, defending foreign borders, but now we are finally protecting our nation rebuilding our cities.","We are protecting our borders. You know the world is almost finished right. Our southern border and by the way the biggest beneficiary maybe happens to be Arizona that wall. How good is the wall? The governor was telling me before they stopped coming in now they come in. They come in legally. Now the wall is great, goes down deep and it goes up high, no more tunneling and we're bringing our jobs, our factories, our troops back home in the USA, where they belong all right.","Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. Our southern border is now - and I want to thank Mexico. Mexico has right now, 27000 troops guarding our border. How about that - and we built almost 400 miles of the wall, we're averaging about 10 miles a day and it's the best. It's exactly what Border Patrol wanted.","I said I'd like to just put up: I just like to put up concrete plans. They said, No, sir. We've got to have it this way, sir. We gave him the ultimate. We gave them everything they wanted and they're really happy, and it's had a huge impact. We've got the best. We've got the best border that we've ever had, and you know what you have a big chunk of it right here and it's really work.","You have 200 miles, they tell me 200 miles to 100 miles. I didn't even know you. That's a lot of mileage you're, not paying a damn percent for it. Well, compliments of the federal government, but remember when Nancy Pelosi they all said we don't need a wall. Walls are obsolete, two things, don't get obsolete walls and wheels right.","Everything else is obsolete. You know they developed a new chip yesterday in about 15 minutes, it's going to be obsolete. They developed a new computer 15 minutes obsolete the two things that will never be obsolete. A wheel and a wall. Remember the Democrats, they said no, we want drones. We want drones, so you can have drones watching everybody pour into the country, no no two hundred miles of wall in Arizona, and you got it all.","It's all done joe, Biden. His party continues to attack our incredible border agents and they are more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic. Americans. I know a lot of them right there now. You know this our guys here am I right all right. The Republican Party will always stand with the heroes of ice and border patrol.","These are incredible people. They do an incredible job. My opponent's immigration plan is the most extreme proposal ever put forward. Biden's plan would eliminate U.S. borders by implementing nationwide catch and they went nationwide catch and really you know catch releases you catch him, take their name, they could be murderers, rapists and then you release him into our country.","Guess what we don't do that anymore? Ok, that wasn't easy, but it would have made every community into and they want to make every community into a sanctuary city and they want to suspend all removals of illegal aliens. So what they're doing - and this is done by crazy, Bernie right - you know Bernie Sanders made a deal.","We got the manifesto with Joe Biden and it's further left than Bernie ever was joe - did a great job of negotiation supposed to bring him to the right. He brought him to the left, it would mean the total nullification of U.S. borders overwhelming every city and town in America. MS-13 and criminal cartels would rampage throughout our country freely.","If Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your health care is gone. The middle class is gone and your safety is gone other than that he's doing quite a good job. From the moment I took office, I worked night and day to stop illegal immigration. It wasn't easy and now we've got it and stopping it for Arizona was a. I was a big deal, I ended catch and release.","I closed the lobbyist loopholes. I took down the smugglers and coyotes season that nice people by the way, and I kept my promise to the American people. We are finding the drug dealers all over and we are arresting the drug dealers like they have never been arrested before we're finding the predators we're finding the gang members we're finding MS-13 killers and we are either throwing them in jail or sending them to hell.","Back home, where they came from, we invested $2.5 trillion in our military. We have the greatest equipment now anywhere in the world, and you know when I first got here a very highly overrated general told me, sir. We have no ammunition, I said no president should ever hear that we have no ammunition.","Truly. This was a general. I didn't have a lot of respect for, but he said we had no ammunition, so I said well, we have to do something: we've got $2.5 trillion. We now are the envy of the world. We have weapons the likes of which nobody in the world has Russia, China. By and for our vets, we passed V.A. Choice and V.A. Accountability, we kill the leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi, and we took out the world's number one terrorist and mass murderer of American troops and many many people Qasem Soleimani.","He is dead. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal $150 billion. 1.8 billion in cash, not the best deal I would have been ending now almost anyway. I recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.","They've been working on that for 52 years. I got it done in two hours and instead of the endless wars, we're forging peace in the Middle East, no blood in the sand. I did more in forty-seven months than Joe Biden did in forty-seven years. A vote for Republicans is a vote for Safe Communities, great jobs, a limitless future, and for the American dream.","It's for the American dream. Remember you know. The Republican Party is the party of Abraham Lincoln right there with party of America. You know Abraham Lincoln. I tell that to people, they never knew they said, Gee. I never knew that, but Abraham, honest Abe was a special person, but in conclusion, over the next four years we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all.","It's already happened. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous foreign wars, foreign Wars, countries you've, never even heard of we will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength.","We will end surprise. Medical billing require price transparency. It's already done. It's all. Science starts on January. 1St it'll be more important. Watch than health care, it'll be even more important. I'm telling you it's the numbers you're talking about price transparency, remember further reduce the costs of prescription drugs and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions.","Always America will land. The first woman in the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. It's happening soon and NASA is down the space center of the world. Again it was a mess. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools.","We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag, and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God, We Trust for years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Arizona.","This is the most important election in the history of our country. Is the most important I never thought I'd be saying that it's the most important. Thank you very much. Very much appreciate it. This is the most important election in the history of our country, and I never did it I'd. Never thought I'd be saying that, but I'm seeing where these people want to take us they want to take us into a land.","That's never worked. Look at Venezuela, it's the same ideology, same philosophy, it's just a much bigger version, but it can happen. We can't let it happen. The United States will never be a socialist nation, ken, So get your friends get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get your boss and get out and vote from Phoenix to Flagstaff from Mesa to Yuma. > From tombstone.","What a great name to write here in Tucson we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul for our liberty and for our freedom, this great great, great state. I love this state. I love this. It's been, you know what Arizona has been good to me from the beginning.","From the beginning, from day, one right, we had the big victory. My first speech was in Arizona right, no phoenix, remember that we had this big convention hall. I said How the hell are you going to fill it and we had that thing packed and there were lines outside they couldn't get in. I said Wow and that's when the fake news started saying What the hell is going on with this Trump guy right.","Remember that in Phoenix a big convention center was packed and there were thousands and thousands of people that it was my first speech and they started saying. What's that all about even I said: What's that all about right, but I'm glad we all did it. We did it together, and this was the first place Arizona.","Thank you very much. Thank you. This great state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the earth. Arizona is where Wyatt, Earp and Doc Holliday became American legends. Wyatt Earp is where the great American West became the American dream and Arizona is the state where generations of pioneers and prospectors miners and ranchers cowboys and cattle hands, marshals and lawman tamed the frontier braved.","The blazing sun, like I'm doing right now, I'm going to be back you're going to see me tomorrow. I'm going to look like a lobster, you're going to say, look what we did to him. They said. Would you like to wear a hat? I said there is no way I'm wearing a hat. I got his shoulders, we've got to show strength, right, frank, and showed the entire world how the West Was Won.","This is it, they helped make America into the greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. Capital tap, proud citizens, like you, helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion, and your drive.","We are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Arizona, we have made America powerful. Again we have made America wealthy again stock market.","We have made America strong again, our military. We have made America proud again, we have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Arizona get out and vote get out and vote. Thank you."],"text":" Thank you. Thank you. What a crowd wow! Thank you. Thank you, Tucson. Thank you very much. You son, I'm thrilled to be in Arizona with the thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Fifteen days from now we're going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win four more years in that beautiful White House. Everybody needs to get out and vote return, your absentee ballot, or vert. You know you can go out there. I think today, when do you do it today tomorrow, whatever you can go and vote today, they say today go out and vote that beats a ballot. Do you agree that beats a ballot? Remember the old fashioned days when you'd actually go out and vote today. They send you millions of ballots. Are you okay? Over there, everyone fine, good? Ok, he looks better than I do that guy he looks better than I do good. Thank you. You make sure you're. Ok with your vote will continue to cut your taxes and regulations. Maintain energy independence, which we have now strengthened our military support, our police protect our Second Amendment. I don't see you people, I don't think you're going to want to give up those guns. I don't think so. That's not that's that for Arizona, defend our borders, arrest, violent criminals, and confirm more judges to uphold the rule of law. Under my leadership, prosperity will surge. What we've done in the last three and a half years has been incredible. Nobody's ever done what we've done. There is no administration, that's accomplished what we've accomplished in the first three and a half years, not even optimism will boom the pandemic. It's rounding, the turn vaccines are coming and I look, fine Donna. You know and we'll get back to a normal life. That's what we want just a normal just seven months ago. We want to get back. It will be better than that very soon we built a foundation. That's so strong and you see what's happening stock market through the roof you for one case through the roof, your stock through the roof, your housing through the roof. Everything is good, your optimism, and what about 56 percent of the people? Just a Gallup poll just came out. Fifty-six percent of the people say they're better off today than they were four years ago and we have a pandemic, and next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. That's what's going to happen. We're cutting your taxes, they're, raising your taxes, that's an easy one. To figure out is it this election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden depression. If he even gets to run it's a choice between getting a safe vaccine and getting back in and working and by the way you have a governor here today, he's done a great job and he's kept. You open your open, unlike some of them like Michigan. You know we won the case in Michigan, you know the only one that was allowed to have a good time was the governor's husband he was allowed to do whatever the hell he wanted, but nobody else they would like in a prison, but we're going to have A safe vaccine and Biden you know he's going to do lock them down, let's lock everybody down, but we built the greatest economy. Ever we had to close it down. We saved millions of lives. By doing what we did, then we built it back up and now we're doing record type numbers and it's a choice between the American dream or a socialist nightmare. That's what it is Biden will delay therapies, postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools and shut down our country and we're opening and we're opening rapidly and we've got a V shape. It may be a super-V. It looks like it's a super-V which nobody ever even heard of before he will massively raise your taxes. Bury your rag. You will be buried in regulations. You know we cut regulations, it would take 18 to 21 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to one year and you know what from two to one we're very shortly to be exact right now, it's listed to have it down to one year and it may get rejected for environmental reasons or safety, and that's OK, probably not, but that's. Ok, but you know what you're going to have it approved or not approved, and it's a one year process, not a 21-year process, and this is going on all over the country and in my opinion, what we've done and regulations is even more important than the Biggest tax cut in the history of our country, I think it's immoral and they're going to bring all those regulations back. They want to dismantle your police department's. Dissolve your borders, dissolve your borders. If you don't have borders, you don't have a country confiscate your guns, ban. American energy wipe out private health care hundred and eighty million people terminate religious liberty. This is for the women, the women who live in the suburbs. They want to destroy your suburbs and I ended the rule that was going to destroy. I ended the regulation that was going to this. I kept hearing that women from the suburbs won't like Trump. I said Why? Because I'm stopping crime you're going to have the suburbs, be safe suburbs, you're, having safe suburbs and you're not going to have low-income housing projects built next to your house, we ended the regulation that would have destroyed your suburbs. It's amazing how the women like all of a sudden and, as you know, the Democrats, they want to cut our military to the bone and we built the greatest military right now in the history of our country. Frankly, in the history of the world, Biden will surrender your jobs to China. He will surrender your future to the virus and he will surrender your country to the radical socialist left and you see that happening. The only thing Biden wants to do is get as much as he can for himself. Have you been watching this whole thing play out? I didn't know anything about it. Oh, here's a picture Biden playing golf with his mom. I didn't know my son was taking money from the receiver. I didn't know my son got $3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow, his wife. I wonder why and then you see all the things right that we have to give the man 10 percent. We have to give the man 10 percent right boy I'll, tell you nobody's ever seen in the media right and big tech. They won't, they won't allow it. Charlie Kirk, you know Charlie Kirk, great guy, they shut down his site because he mentioned it. Look he's a corrupt politician. This guy he's a corrupt politician to get the power by this made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination. He has handed control of his party over to the socialists, the communists, the Marxists, and the left-wing extremist and that's before we get to his own personal corruption, which is more than anybody in history. I say this: it's the second biggest scandal politically in the history of our country. No one was spying on my campaign and getting caught Biden even chose as his running mate. The most liberal senator in America, Kamala Kamala senator Kamala Harris, is a sponsor of the Socialist Green New Deal and legislation to strip away the private health plans of 180 million Americans, and you know her and Bernie Sanders want to do something in Arizona. They have some deal in Arizona where your taxes are going to go way up. You know that right, your governor who's right over here, your great governor, is saying he's not happy with it, but Bernie Sanders the second most liberal person. You know she's first-rate she's conservative. They want to raise your taxes, eight and a half percent. So I'm glad governor he's saying more, it's probably more. What is the name of that governor rule? What right you know about it? Ok, you can't have a mint because they control Biden, 100 percent Biden, a shot. You know he shot right. He's Gonzo harris also urged his supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out the riot as the ones that knocked out your towns. You cities not in Republican areas, by the way, all in Democrat areas, you look at Portland that we wouldn't take in 15 minutes. We could have solved that we told the governor Democrat. Let us in we'll solve that problem. We went into Minneapolis. It took us a half an hour that was over with, unfortunately, they could have called a little earlier and in Seattle, they gave up when they heard we were going in the next morning, but we would just look all Democrat areas New York going to hell. I feel so sad with New York. Crime is up 250 percent, Cuomo. A terrible thing has happened in New York. Look at Chicago Democrat again: crime is through the roof that a weekend eighty-seven people were shot and 16 died. Okay, now do you believe this isn't a war in Afghanistan? You don't lose. Many people were coming out by the way. It's all coming, we're all coming back home, but you go to war zones, you don't have that and we could solve it so easily. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You know, there's never been that chance before seriously. We all like Ronald Reagan, I guess he'd be, but he never had that share. We love you think of it. We love you you're, going to make me cry, don't do that. I don't want to cry, I don't want to cry, make me cry, you'll destroy my image, and then you love me and he won't ever be there. I appreciate it now. I do and I feel the same way. That's why I'm doing this. I had a good life before I did this stuff. Believe me, my life was very simple and very nice. The Democrat Party's Warren Copps is inciting riots and putting police officers and American families in very grave danger. Unlike Joe Biden, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement and I was endorsed by almost every law enforcement group in the United States, including New York's, finest and Chicago and Florida and Texas and Oklahoma and every place, and I was just named. I have to say this happened today, the man of the year in that big magazine, The Blue magazine good day for man of the year. So I just tell you that, for whatever reason I take, I'm the only one standing between you and a left-wing crusade. You know you have people, they want to change our whole country, and the thing that's going to bring us back together is success because I'll tell you we were ready. I was getting calls seven months ago we had the best employment numbers we ever had with the greatest success we've ever had. We were beating China at everything. You know you kept hearing about it, we were beating everybody and they were calling me people that I wouldn't be speaking to generally. Let's get together, it was happening and then we got hit by the China plague and then we had to start all over again, but it will success brings us together. I saw it and we saw it for two months. It was really going on a new study of the Biden. Harris agenda found that their plans will crater the typical American family by more than six thousand five hundred dollars, they're horrible horrible plans to finance what the blue the new Green Deal. The Green New Deal is the craziest thing right: no, more airplanes, no more double cars, no more cows. If you have a ranch, you won't have cows anymore, no more! You you'll be next. In just three years. I increase family income by six thousand dollars and we're not even talking about the energy. Did you ever think you'd be seeing two-dollar gasoline again and you got that and it's plentiful and we saved all our energy jobs. All of our energy jobs, we said Biden will eviscerate the middle class. My policies will lift the middle class to record highs and that's where we're going very quickly. For the last forty-seven years, sleepy Joe Biden has shipped away your jobs shut down. Your factories threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries. You've, never even heard of Joe Biden is a servant of the left-wing globalists and lobbyists the wealthy donors, the Washington vultures, who got rich bleeding America dry. You know they raised a lot of money. The Democrats, you know why, because they make deals they make deals. I would be the greatest fundraiser in history. If I wanted to call Wall Street normal, I want $10 million for my campaign. Yes, sir, all I have to say is: I want 10 million. I want 15, I want 25. I would set every record, but you know what happens when you do that: you're selling yourself out when you have to do something. You can't do it anymore, because you feel guilty, you see them setting all sorts of records. I know with the records. Are the records every time they set a record? They gave away everything in 2016. You voted to fire, this corrupt and decrepit political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first, it's about time. Joe Biden is always and always has been a corrupt politician. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and you know what you knew that and a lot of people knew it for a long time. But now you have the laptop it's over and as far as I'm concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise and that's what it is. A criminal enterprise, smoking gun e-mails showed we just found them. You saw that. Did you see a shifty shift? We think that the laptop was made by Russia. Oh, I see. Oh, he just said it was made by Russia. Here we go again: Russia did it: Russia, Russia, Russia. You know the head of DNI John Ratcliffe was fantastic, came out and said that was false information. Now, these are bad people. These are sick people, you notice, they never say it was made by China because they're all on the take smoking gun e-mails show just came out that the Biden family used the vice presidency as a for-profit cash machine and that Joe Biden has been lying to The American public to cover it up, remember, he said, No, I never met anybody from Paris knows it is in Paris, but actually that I understand because he's got no memory left. Its guns is in Paris right. No, I don't read, and then they show a picture of him playing golf with the head of charisma boy. Oh boy, if Biden wins China wins and China will own the USA. Remember what I said: the media and big tech is trying to hide the entire scandal. You believe what they're doing they're taking people like Charlie, Kirk, and others off if they even mention that Biden is corrupt and they know he's corrupt, but he's -- they're, corrupt, he's so perfect for them he's their corrupt because they know that publicizing. These revelations would mean an end of Biden's presidential run. I think it's an end right now. Look, you know, I think it's an end right now how the hell did you do when you see the kind of things that they do where the big guy has to get at least 10 percent, the big guy I wouldn't know who the big guy is. I wonder when you see what, if you put him as president, you should be ashamed of yourselves. You want to know that I'm not just running against Biden, I'm running against the left-wing media, the big tech giants, and the Washington swamp and I've been running against it from the, and here I am all by myself. It's fearless anybody else. There would have been in a corner right now, thumb in mouth, saying: Mommy, take me home Mommy. I want to go nowadays. It's great. You know why it's great, though, because nobody's ever done well, we've done nobody. They flood your communities with criminal aliens, drugs, and crime. While they live behind beautiful gated communities, they try to take away your guns while they enjoy private security is fully armed by the way. How fully armed? How about Bloomberg? We are fighting guns and he's got five guys around him with guns. They support crippling lockdowns, while their jobs and their industry remain totally exempt it's time to send a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites in Washington and in Silicon Valley show them. The American people are in charge by delivering their chosen candidates sleepy Joe Biden, who shouldn't even be their candidate. He should have laws because Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren if she wanted dropped out the day before Super Tuesday Joe, would have lost every single state to crazy Bernie. It's a very simple business, but we have to show them the Democrats, a thundering defeat on November 3rd and if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician webster's. If I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment. It's because I was elected to fight for you, hotter than anyone has ever fought for you and I'm fighting so hard. I had a great life, I'm fighting so hard because I love my country and because I'm determined to ensure that the forgotten men and women of this country are never forgotten again and they won't be. And we taught that lesson to him four years ago. But we're going to teach him again because this is the most important you know I used to go few months ago to say: well I don't know this is important, that's important, which is more important. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Divided agenda would be a catastrophe for Arizona seniors. Do we have any seniors in the House? Biden is pledging mass amnesty and free federal health care for illegal aliens? You saw that where he was up on the stage with his radical left Democrats, who is willing to give free health care to illegal immigrants right, they said to illegal immigrants right and everybody raised their hand and Biden couldn't get his up because he knew you know. He's been doing this crap for 47 years right, he couldn't, he knew it was wrong, but then he looked at his brain and shot. So I looked over at him and their hands were all up there. He looked over there and their hands were all up there. A lot of them he knew it was wrong because it would be so horrible for our country because everyone's gonna flood, our country, you get free healthcare right. You get free healthcare, you get free education, I jokingly said, and everybody gets a Rolls Royce and CNN said: that's a lie. So what happened? Is he couldn't get it up and then he looked and he left and he got it up and I said thank you. We just won the election, he would decimate Medicare if he did that, and it's not going to be up to him. That's his party, that's what they want. They want socialized, medicine and he'll destroy your Social Security. While I'm president, no one will touch your Medicare or your Social Security. You know the amazing thing Biden is always complaining. Oh, he didn't stop China fast enough, except he didn't want to stop him at all. You know little things like this, but you know he's always complaining, and yet he was here for 47 years right, I say, Joe Joe, it's not like you're an outsider, and it wasn't that long ago, either forty-seven years and all he does is complain. Biden said 47 years to fight for seniors and reduce prescription drug costs. Look what I've done and I've just exercised they're going to come down. 70. 80. 90 percent, because I just did something that nobody thought anybody would do. A favorite nation's flaws would pay the lowest in the world. You'll see numbers that are shocking, they're, not happy with me. The Big Pharma Big Pharma is spending a lot of money. When you see those ads, please remember every one of those ads means your drug prices are coming down. They can't believe I tried to make a deal with them. I did I tried, but we couldn't in the end we couldn't they got too greedy, too much money too much money, but you know. Last year we brought drug prices down 1 percent, I'm not bragging about it's the first time in 52 years that drug prices came down, but now we're going for the big one. Now we're going for the big one and you know rebates. You know the richest people, the middlemen, you know the middleman about drugs. You know that we have middlemen, nobody knows who the hell. They are never hear middle women. I hear middlemen so we'll make it politically correct: middle men. No, they called middlemen. Nobody knows who they are. These guys are so rich. Who are they I'll bet? You, Hunter, gets a piece of the action. Did it hunter Biden? Is a middle man on top of everything he gets it from China. He gets it from Ukraine. He got three and a half million from Russia from Moscow. He got three and a half and on top of everything else, he's a middle man now, but he is, he probably gets a piece of the action, but instead, he sells seniors out to the drug lobby and to big pharma. That's Biden's senior, I'm taking on the powerful special interests like never before nobody's ever done this before nobody's ever done it before I mean you know, for years you heard about drug prices, nobody ever did anything and now you hear about drug prices and they drop and They're going to be dropping like a rock, also I'm letting your governor, your great governor, buy until the thing kicks in and probably litigation. But you know I've exercised this whole thing with favorite nation. So if Germany pays 10 cents for a pill and we're paying two and a half dollars - and you have that kind of despair, it is ridiculous that we have the right to match. In other words, we get the lowest price, but until it kicks in Canada, pays half of what we pay. So I'm letting your governor and other governors go to. Canada buy your drugs through Canada, save 50 percent. We get rid of the middleman. The other thing we did very big much less than what we're talking about, but very big. We capped insulin costs for medicine and Medicare for Medicare plans at less than thirty-five dollars a month. People were dying because they couldn't afford insulin. 33 million seniors thirty-three. I think it is thirty-five dollars, but 33 million seniors on Medicare will soon be receiving two hundred dollars to help with their drug costs, on top of everything else nobody's done by the way. In all fairness, nobody has done anything like this, but your big thing, your big thing, is going to be when you see what happens with the favorite nations because you've been hearing about it for years where other countries are paying a tiny fraction of what we bear. All of the cost, because our politicians sold us out, they sold us out, but I'm not a politician. So it's one of the I couldn't stand watching to battle the China virus. We launched the largest mobilization since World War. Two are early and aggressive action saved more than 2 million lives. I acted early to ban travel from China and Japan. How about this? You should have done it sooner, but in the meantime, when I did it, he called me xenophobic right, and then months later he agreed that I was right and now he's saying I should have done it sooner this guy. I also banned it from Europe because I saw with Italy and with Spain and with France, and by the way, they have a big spike right now they have a very big spike right now and we're doing good. We are rounding the turn we have the vaccines coming in all, but even without we're rounding the turn people are pandemic out. You know that they're pandemic out. That's why it's so great. Would you governors done he's, opened up your state you're doing great, we pioneered lives and by the way you get it. You know, like I say here. I am I'm here, I'm here and now I'm immune. I can jump into this audience and kiss every man and woman I'm a it used to be you're immune for life, and then, when I got it I said I'm immune. They said it's only good for four months, see if anybody else you understand that right, I'll jump into that audience right. We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced their fate, tally rate. Eighty-five percent - think of it, and I had it too. I didn't feel good. I feel that's so great and I'm not used to that, and we can't let that happen to a president, because we know we have to be at the top of our game. That's why you can't let Biden be president because he's not at the top of his game mentally can't. Have that one thing I can tell you Putin, President Xi of China Kim Jong-un, all of them macro they're very much at the top of their game. You can't let this happen to our country, you can't, but I was it. I was laying, and you know if your president, one thing: you're guaranteed lots of doctors and they would grab me at a grab me by every part. They had hands or love music. Get the hell out of here, I just don't feel good and we ended up. I used the drug regeneration which nobody ever thought about six months ago and I woke up the next morning and I was like I felt like Superman get me out of here. I said get me out of here and Eli Lilly makes a similar product and we're going to distribute that we're trying to get emergency use. So we can do it faster because it's early, but it's fantastic antibodies and we're going to distribute it all over and we're going to make sure that people that have a problem they get the same drug as I got, and I'm telling you it'll be the same result, it'll be the same result and it's free we're going to do it. Three companies are working with us because it's not their fault, it's China's fault, it's not their fault, but I woke up and I felt good I said, get me out of here boom Superman through Operation warp speed. We will have one hundred million vaccine doses before the end of the year and our military is going to distribute them and they are there's nobody like our military. The vaccine will end the pandemic, but even without the vaccine, the pandemic is ending, it's got and it ends with it. But you know this: can this can go quickly? This can make it go a lot faster. Biden's, lockdown will crush America. My plan will crush the virus and bring back your American dream, so we're joined today by some very special people, a friend of mine, somebody, that's been with me from the beginning. I've been with him from the beginning, he's very difficult because when he needs something for the state like money, he'll call me all the time I say, Doug. Do me a favor. Give me a break, but I guess that's what you're supposed to do right? That's what you want he's supposed to call, and finally, I say all right: Doug you got to get out. You promise not to call the no call me two weeks later. I need more, but he's a great governor. One of the greatest governors he's done a fantastic job, you're down to very low numbers by the way Doug do see Doug please, and we want you to vote for Martha McSally save your Second Amendment. Save your Second Amendment. Doug. You want to come up. Come up. Doug come in for a second come on Doug I'll, tell you this guy has been a great guy. I don't know if you like him or not. Ok, he's been a great. Donald Trump will win. Arizona, Donald Trump will be reelected, president of the United States, and, along with Donald Trump and Mike Pence, Martha McSally on November 3rd will join them in the U.S. senate. Mr. President, because of your policies, Arizona's economy is booming. Our home values are rising faster than anywhere else in the nation, and Amy Coney Barrett will be confirmed to the Supreme Court. Do you, Joe Biden is wrong for America, Joe Biden would lock us down. Joe Biden would reduce your income. Sixty-five hundred dollars and Joe Biden would make Washington D.C a state and how many presidents, the United States, would protect Arizona by talking about what Bernie Sanders wants to do here by endorsing Prop 2 0 8 wanting to raise our taxes. Seventy-seven percent. So, on November, 3rd vote no on Prop 208. And vote yes for Donald Trump and Mike Pence to go back to the White House. Thank you. He's a great governor he's a great -- great governor. What a job he's done - and you know what we're not going to take her time or anything but Martha McSally - is here: she's saving your Second Amendment, she's, been a great -- great Senator Martha, come here, she's been a great -- great senator and just go out and vote For Martha, McSally save your Second Amendment. Save me second amendment. Thank you I'll see you thank you. Darling, she's done a great job and she's a work she's a great fighter pilot. He told me all about her some of the pilots. They said she was a great fighter pilot, so thank you, Martha. Thank you. Thank you. Doug. We also have a congressional candidate that they say is a star in the making. I've heard it from a lot of people. Vote for Brandon Mark was Brandon Brandon. Good luck! Man, I hear it's going good. Thank you, Brandon Brandon Martin. Thank you, Brandon you're, going to do great. I heard you're doing really well. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we're doing it again. You know it's make America great again right, I say Make America Great Again again again again, we did it and now we had to do it again. It's all right. It's happening and it's happening. Much faster looks like a super-V in my first three years. We increased family income more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. I think it is five times more in the first three years, five times more than eight years of the Obama Biden administration, that's not even believable African-American unemployment, Hispanic, American unemployment, Asian American unemployment, all reached record lows, the lowest in the history of our country. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. That's a record and I'm doing very well in the polls with Hispanic Americans. But I always like you - and you always like me to fake news. Just didn't know that our policies are lifting up all Americans of every income since the China virus we created eleven point four million American jobs. It's a record to nobody's ever seen. Anything like you know the unemployment rate. Normally, I wouldn't be happy about this right, but the unemployment rate a week ago hit 7.8 percent. Think of that now we were hearing 42. It's going to go to 42, it's going to go to 44, it's going to go to thirty! Eight seven point eight percent and heading this way. Think of that, would you believe that no, I wouldn't say it because we were at 3.4, 3.5, and heading even better than that, but that's OK, we'll be there soon after the virus left China. We experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western country and the fastest recovery anywhere in the world from an economy standpoint and we've already cut the unemployment rate in less than half that's a fantastic thing under Biden and Obama took over three and a half years for Arizona to regain 60 percent of the jobs lost in the crisis, and we've done it in four months. Take it that it wasn't our fault, it wasn't. Our fault. Manufacturing production is up, 61 percent retail sales are up. Scuse me one hundred and twenty-one percent. That means more than free for the pandemic and automobile production nobody's going to believe this one is up three hundred and fifty percent since April lows, three hundred and fifty percent. I have a way that we can stop it elect sleepy Joe. No, no you for who has a 4 or 1 k. Ok! So if I tell you that you, for one case and you're, all at record highs are very close right. If I told you that you for one case will be cut in half and much worse than that, that's what's going to happen! You're going to end up in a depression with this guy he's going to raise your taxes by four or five times and they're going to put on regulations. Every company is going to say, let's get out of here because I'll tell you that the regulation cuts which are more than anybody than any administration's ever done. The regulation cuts in their own way were more important than the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. Thank you. As President, I've been delivering for our incredible Hispanic American community like nobody's done before, and I'm fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, and Hispanic owned. Small businesses, Joe Biden, would wipe out your small businesses with lockdowns and regulations. You know he said the other day. Oh, I'd, lock it down. Oh great, that's thanks a lot, Joe. We appreciate and devastate your families with massive tax hikes. He will wage war on Catholic organizations, banned charter, schools fund, extreme late-term, abortion and he'll. Let socialists run wild and we will never have a socialist country. We will never have it, we can't we won't have a cut. That's why we're going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote this November get out and vote get out and vote for decades. Our politicians spent trillions of dollars, rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, defending foreign borders, but now we are finally protecting our nation rebuilding our cities. We are protecting our borders. You know the world is almost finished right. Our southern border and by the way the biggest beneficiary maybe happens to be Arizona that wall. How good is the wall? The governor was telling me before they stopped coming in now they come in. They come in legally. Now the wall is great, goes down deep and it goes up high, no more tunneling and we're bringing our jobs, our factories, our troops back home in the USA, where they belong all right. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. Our southern border is now - and I want to thank Mexico. Mexico has right now, 27000 troops guarding our border. How about that - and we built almost 400 miles of the wall, we're averaging about 10 miles a day and it's the best. It's exactly what Border Patrol wanted. I said I'd like to just put up: I just like to put up concrete plans. They said, No, sir. We've got to have it this way, sir. We gave him the ultimate. We gave them everything they wanted and they're really happy, and it's had a huge impact. We've got the best. We've got the best border that we've ever had, and you know what you have a big chunk of it right here and it's really work. You have 200 miles, they tell me 200 miles to 100 miles. I didn't even know you. That's a lot of mileage you're, not paying a damn percent for it. Well, compliments of the federal government, but remember when Nancy Pelosi they all said we don't need a wall. Walls are obsolete, two things, don't get obsolete walls and wheels right. Everything else is obsolete. You know they developed a new chip yesterday in about 15 minutes, it's going to be obsolete. They developed a new computer 15 minutes obsolete the two things that will never be obsolete. A wheel and a wall. Remember the Democrats, they said no, we want drones. We want drones, so you can have drones watching everybody pour into the country, no no two hundred miles of wall in Arizona, and you got it all. It's all done joe, Biden. His party continues to attack our incredible border agents and they are more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic. Americans. I know a lot of them right there now. You know this our guys here am I right all right. The Republican Party will always stand with the heroes of ice and border patrol. These are incredible people. They do an incredible job. My opponent's immigration plan is the most extreme proposal ever put forward. Biden's plan would eliminate U.S. borders by implementing nationwide catch and they went nationwide catch and really you know catch releases you catch him, take their name, they could be murderers, rapists and then you release him into our country. Guess what we don't do that anymore? Ok, that wasn't easy, but it would have made every community into and they want to make every community into a sanctuary city and they want to suspend all removals of illegal aliens. So what they're doing - and this is done by crazy, Bernie right - you know Bernie Sanders made a deal. We got the manifesto with Joe Biden and it's further left than Bernie ever was joe - did a great job of negotiation supposed to bring him to the right. He brought him to the left, it would mean the total nullification of U.S. borders overwhelming every city and town in America. MS-13 and criminal cartels would rampage throughout our country freely. If Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your health care is gone. The middle class is gone and your safety is gone other than that he's doing quite a good job. From the moment I took office, I worked night and day to stop illegal immigration. It wasn't easy and now we've got it and stopping it for Arizona was a. I was a big deal, I ended catch and release. I closed the lobbyist loopholes. I took down the smugglers and coyotes season that nice people by the way, and I kept my promise to the American people. We are finding the drug dealers all over and we are arresting the drug dealers like they have never been arrested before we're finding the predators we're finding the gang members we're finding MS-13 killers and we are either throwing them in jail or sending them to hell. Back home, where they came from, we invested $2.5 trillion in our military. We have the greatest equipment now anywhere in the world, and you know when I first got here a very highly overrated general told me, sir. We have no ammunition, I said no president should ever hear that we have no ammunition. Truly. This was a general. I didn't have a lot of respect for, but he said we had no ammunition, so I said well, we have to do something: we've got $2.5 trillion. We now are the envy of the world. We have weapons the likes of which nobody in the world has Russia, China. By and for our vets, we passed V.A. Choice and V.A. Accountability, we kill the leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi, and we took out the world's number one terrorist and mass murderer of American troops and many many people Qasem Soleimani. He is dead. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal $150 billion. 1.8 billion in cash, not the best deal I would have been ending now almost anyway. I recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been working on that for 52 years. I got it done in two hours and instead of the endless wars, we're forging peace in the Middle East, no blood in the sand. I did more in forty-seven months than Joe Biden did in forty-seven years. A vote for Republicans is a vote for Safe Communities, great jobs, a limitless future, and for the American dream. It's for the American dream. Remember you know. The Republican Party is the party of Abraham Lincoln right there with party of America. You know Abraham Lincoln. I tell that to people, they never knew they said, Gee. I never knew that, but Abraham, honest Abe was a special person, but in conclusion, over the next four years we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It's already happened. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous foreign wars, foreign Wars, countries you've, never even heard of we will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise. Medical billing require price transparency. It's already done. It's all. Science starts on January. 1St it'll be more important. Watch than health care, it'll be even more important. I'm telling you it's the numbers you're talking about price transparency, remember further reduce the costs of prescription drugs and we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always America will land. The first woman in the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. It's happening soon and NASA is down the space center of the world. Again it was a mess. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag, and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God, We Trust for years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Arizona. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Is the most important I never thought I'd be saying that it's the most important. Thank you very much. Very much appreciate it. This is the most important election in the history of our country, and I never did it I'd. Never thought I'd be saying that, but I'm seeing where these people want to take us they want to take us into a land. That's never worked. Look at Venezuela, it's the same ideology, same philosophy, it's just a much bigger version, but it can happen. We can't let it happen. The United States will never be a socialist nation, ken, So get your friends get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get your boss and get out and vote from Phoenix to Flagstaff from Mesa to Yuma. > From tombstone. What a great name to write here in Tucson we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul for our liberty and for our freedom, this great great, great state. I love this state. I love this. It's been, you know what Arizona has been good to me from the beginning. From the beginning, from day, one right, we had the big victory. My first speech was in Arizona right, no phoenix, remember that we had this big convention hall. I said How the hell are you going to fill it and we had that thing packed and there were lines outside they couldn't get in. I said Wow and that's when the fake news started saying What the hell is going on with this Trump guy right. Remember that in Phoenix a big convention center was packed and there were thousands and thousands of people that it was my first speech and they started saying. What's that all about even I said: What's that all about right, but I'm glad we all did it. We did it together, and this was the first place Arizona. Thank you very much. Thank you. This great state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the earth. Arizona is where Wyatt, Earp and Doc Holliday became American legends. Wyatt Earp is where the great American West became the American dream and Arizona is the state where generations of pioneers and prospectors miners and ranchers cowboys and cattle hands, marshals and lawman tamed the frontier braved. The blazing sun, like I'm doing right now, I'm going to be back you're going to see me tomorrow. I'm going to look like a lobster, you're going to say, look what we did to him. They said. Would you like to wear a hat? I said there is no way I'm wearing a hat. I got his shoulders, we've got to show strength, right, frank, and showed the entire world how the West Was Won. This is it, they helped make America into the greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. Capital tap, proud citizens, like you, helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion, and your drive. We are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Arizona, we have made America powerful. Again we have made America wealthy again stock market. We have made America strong again, our military. We have made America proud again, we have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Arizona get out and vote get out and vote. Thank you."}
