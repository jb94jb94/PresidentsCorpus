Now we're winning, winning, winning the country, and soon the country is going to start winning, winning, winning. So I want to thank the volunteers, they've been unable. These people they worked like endlessly, endlessly.","We're not going to forget it. And we've had some great numbers coming out of Texas. And amazing numbers coming out of Tennessee and Georgia, and Arkansas. And then in a couple of weeks later Florida. We love Florida so.
