Wow what a lot of welcome. It's a terrific place. Terrific. We just got in and we were driving. I'm driving through these beautiful fields I want to grab that corn like you've never seen so rich so beautiful. And thank you for being here on a Saturday. I know you can be doing a lot of other I mean we have such a huge crowd.","We have another room that's packed like this one and people standing outside. They I don't know we can let them in if we can put them up but we had so many people standing outside. I just want to thank you. And actually the Des Moines Register is standing outside to us some. Sort of funny. So it was sort of funny.","So you know it's a super liberal rag not respected around here but they come out with an editorial. Mr. Trump I'm rated number one now in every poll because you know what people are tired of what's gone up because of me get tired and they said so you number one in every poll and they say you should drop your candidacy I say Excuse me. I mean you know why.","But it's such an honor to be here and to discuss some of the things that taken place over the last week. This has been a big week. First of all Hillary is now officially under investigation for the emails. Big big you know if you look at it. Look I don't think anything's going to happen to her because it's all Democrats that are doing the investigation.","I mean. It's the way it is. Right. And. You look at you look at the prosecutors are all Democrats and they want jobs and they want to continue onward. And. You know the attorney general is a Democrat right. Oh that's different. I agree with that. But I say you have all of these people and it's just a game that goes on in Washington it's terrible what's going on and you look at General Petraeus as an example so he was a general did a very good job although I don't know you know that whole thing is such a disaster with what's going.","But he did a good job and he was a respected guy and he did much less than Hillary much less in terms of information in terms of importance in terms of volume. I mean he gave a little bit. You talked about years and years and thousands of emails and they destroyed his life. His life is over. They've destroyed him.","He's like a ruined man. I saw him. He's like a ruined demand. And. With Hillary she's supposed to be running and she's favored to win not against me she's not favorite. I'll tell you that. But she's favorite to win. So. Look if the prosecutors are honorable. And they may be if they're fair if they're just sadly bad stuff has to happen because what she did is very criminal and very serious and it's too bad it's too bad.","And I don't I don't know how a person with that cloud over their head actually can be running for the office of president. You know you wouldn't think so. So we'll see what happens it'll be very interesting. And you don't hear that talk from other politicians it's almost like they have you know even these Republican guys that I'm running against it's like you're not going to hear that.","You know they protect each other because they say that could be them. That could be this. I've got to take it easy I don't want to me I don't care. I say the truth. So I went to Laredo and my wife came home and she was crying and I said to myself why are you crying. You made it home You made it safely from the border.","She was crying tears were coming down her face because she thought it was so dangerous. And I said to myself she either really loves me a lot or she's got a pretty good line of stuff going OK. But it was a little bit you know scary going over the border. And while I was there and by the way I have to tell you the mayor.","Pete great guy really great guy and he's a Democrat but he's a great guy. And they gave us such good treatment. The law enforcement there is unbelievable including the Border Patrol. You know they were told as I was in the air from Washington don't be there for Trump DON'T BE FOR TRUMP They're the ones that invited me the Border Patrol.","They're incredible people. And they were told in that area which you'd call a local. But there are hundreds or actually thousands of border patrol guys and women tremendous people like the people I just met outside some of the law enforcement people the sheriff some of these people are great. I'm not going to mess with them it's true.","No I looked at some of these people outside I said you know what. Nobody's messing with me today. Not with them. But. But when I went there I saw you know the mayor couldn't have been nicer. I saw the city manager Hey Suze great guy. And they gave me a whole big tour of a lot of different things. And the Border Patrol people were told not to be there from Washington.","They were told from Washington. I wonder who told them I won't. But they said don't be there. And you know by the end of the trip many many Border Patrol people came to see me anyway. I mean they actually disobeyed orders then I actually made a third stop that wasn't anticipated right by the airport. And I spoke to law enforcement and a lot of the Border Patrol.","The reason they wanted me to be there. You know it's pretty simple especially down in the valley. It's really dangerous. It's really really dangerous. There's the border. Remember I made the statement about Mexico is sending in people who come in every year so what a horrible thing. Well now I've been I have journalists calling me up I have people calling me up saying We apologize.","I was right. And then And then of course you had Kate beautiful Kate incredible family the mother the father the brother Brad. They're incredible people I spoke to him and you have these people and they are living in hell. They lost this incredible person shot as you know the story very well shot by an illegal immigrant that came over.","Had to know he was forced over or he came over five times and then the fifth time was disastrous for a family and for a country frankly. And Jamiel the football player. Young boy incredible father Jamiel Shaw who I got to know. Unbelievable kid. And he was coming home he's walking home from the deli. A few minutes away from the house and his father tells the staff I everybody even the reporters I knew some hard veteran reporters and there's tears coming down their eyes we had a conference in California a couple of weeks ago with six families who lost their children to illegal immigrants.","It's a big problem. Such a big problem. And nobody wants to talk about it. Suc h a big problem in the case of Jamiel applying to Stanford. Excellent player good student. Incredible parents and father who I got to know the father really well and he was five minutes away and this guy just walks up to him and shoots him and after he's down he takes a gun and shoots him again and he didn't do anything fact he called his father because his father affectionately like my kids he said old man he used to call a moment old man I'll be home in about four minutes and right after that a minute later the father heard a shot and he said Oh no no that can't be and his son was laying there shot by. An animal an animal that shouldn't have been in this country and people coming across the border coming from many places not just Mexico I mean they're coming from many places and you know they tried to put on Mexico I love the Mexican people I have such a great eye.","Thousands of people over the years thousands of people from Mexico from all over Hispanics that worked for me. They'r e incredible people they work hard they're great people. And Mexico is a country I respect and I've said this. The problem is that their leaders are too smart too cunning they're just better.","They negotiate better. They're tougher. They're much smarter than our leaders our leaders are dummies. They don't know what's happening. It's true. No they're incompetent. They're incompetent. Along with our sanctuary cities nobody even heard the term. And frankly I hate to brag. If it wasn't for me you would still never have heard of the word sanctuary city.","I hate to tell you that and you know things that we never even heard about. And what's happening is there's a movement going on folks. You know there's a movement going on and it's a very strong movement. We want to take back this country. We have to take it back. We have to take it. APPLAUSE AND Baxley one of the very big reporters call me and actually use the word movement because as you know they just came out the economist just kept very highly respected business magazine very respected poll and they just came out and I think I'm at 28 and Walker is at 14. And we'll talk about Walker in a second because that's the whole big story but Walker's at 14. I think Bush's at 13 28 and saying what's going on some movement.","I'm telling you so. So when I was in Laredo I met some incredible people and I'm watching and I'm watching thousands and thousands of trucks and buses and cars. Basically it's a gate. It's a gateway into Mexico. And I asked people that were their experts because they were giving me like a whole big Charette.","And I asked some of the people said so let me guess because I was looking at these cars just flowing and trucks flowing into Mexico. And again I respect Mexico for this. I like Mexico for this. I just wish our leaders were the same. I'm not knocking them. I don't not China because they outsmart our country.","They make we rebuilt China with the money they drained out of our country. We rebuilt it. That doesn't mean you know the largest bank in the world is my tenant. How could I dislike China. They pay me a lot of money. Through Chinese bank. The biggest so much bigger. I said How does it compare to Citibank.","That is like a small subsidiary. That's what they told a small subsidiary. Now I have the lar gest bank in the world I sell millions and millions of dollars. I mean when I sell a condo for 25 million to a man from China for 45 million for 30 million for 10 million for 5 million to China am I going to dislike them I love them but their leaders are much smarter than our latest.","Same thing with Mexico where they make a fortune. And I respect that people said I don't like Mex I love Mexico. I just want our country to be well represented. You know free trade is a good thing. But the one problem with free trade is you have to have really smart leaders and you have have to have great negotiators because what being killed were being killed in negotiation so while I was at Laredo I noticed something very unusual I said.","Number one I saw that traffic was so massive and it was so nice to me they stopped the traffic for while I'm there to do me a favor let those poor people go. They said no no we want to stop. Let them go. They go into Mexico to spend money. But here's what happened. So while whether you probably read it it was in Drudge who's great by the way Drudge is amazing.","But the story on Drudge and big stories all over the place now guys swimming across in big bags of stuff trucks swimming across the river right. Swimming right across. And they put the drugs and actually the camera crew or the reporters were. Petrified because they thought they were gonna be killed. Because they have chosen this on camera.","The guys carrying bags of stuff. It was drugs. And then ABC the big one I always got ABC at 630 but the big one. And they have their cameras are setting up and two guys go running by. And there are two other people running behind them trying to catch them from the water this and this is the g ood part of the border because as they say oh the valley is much you know the Valley is that's trouble.","And I saw something that was amazing. I said to let me see the drugs come through. And what goes back cash. Oh so Mexico has the best of all worlds again out of respect. The drugs come through and the cash goes back to Mexico. So we get the worst of two ends. We lose our cash and we have drugs all over the country.","How stupid a way how stupid. Think of how stupid applause so that wouldn't happen with me. Believe me that won't happen with me. And we have you know sometimes you say sometime and it was a great experience for me. I mean told the pilots I said fly a little bit away from the border please just you know go fly a little bit inland.","But it's a whole scary thing. You know when you're afraid to walk into your own country. Pretty bad. Hard to believe. You don't have that problem in Iowa and offer it is but it's pretty rough out there. But think of it. So the drugs come in. We get the drugs bad stuff. The cash goes out. But I mean so we get it but so it's got to be straightened out.","We need a border. It's got to be strong combination of walls combinations of fence combinations of great Border Patrol. These people are great. The reason they wanted to meet me is because they want to explain how bad it was. That's all. They didn't like the way I look they liked what I said. And many of the families that testified last week before Congress whose children were killed.","I was so honored but more honored than just about anything I've done. They said if it weren't for Donald Trump nobody would even know how serious this problem is I was so honored almost all of them said. Applause. So we need borders. We have to stop illegal immigration. And by the way immigration is a great thing.","Illegal immigration is a great thing. And maybe we should speed up the process. We should definitely speed up the process. And we should take people in that a great people sort of a merit system. You know when I went to school I had like a marriage. We did good didn't you know we felt good we got an A. We got to be we got to see whatever we got but we don't have anything.","We just have people flowing in and staying and in some cases they're not people that Mexico wants because they say why should we take these people that are rough. Why should we take the certain people that are rough and put them in our prisons when the extremely dumb politicians in the United States will put them in their prisons or worse or worse will not put them in prison at all.","Well let them just roam around shooting people and killing people. OK. So then we have another thing happened this week the Iran deal. OK. You know I say I sometimes start speeches by saying we don't win anymore in this country. What a win. What was the last time we won. What a win. When did we beat China in a trade deal.","We don't win. When do we beat Japan. I mean Japan sends as millions of cars I was in Los Angeles this week I looked at some of these boats. They're the biggest boats I've been around I've seen boats the biggest boats I've ever seen. They're sending us millions of cars. We send them in all due respect weak.","Not a good trade. I love we. It's wonderful. But I'd rather be sending the cars in the way. Does it make sense to you folks. We send them cattle and in many cases as you know you've been reading they won't take our cattle because the farmers don't want it. They're always fighting to get it in. And yet they drop millions and millions of cars.","So I heard that the stat is about let's say we're 100 percent over here and we're under 20 pe rcent over here. So we're sending 19 20 percent and not as profitable stuff because it's very perishable. So we're very expensive to transport was a car you put it on the boat and it goes right. So you get you. We're sending them very perishable stuff here.","That's 20 percent. They're sending us automobiles that we have up. To our gills. So that's over here. Right. And I said to myself so easy. All you have to do is say hey look you won't take our cattle you won't take our wheat you won't take anything you don't want it because you say the farmers don't want.","OK I understand that but maybe we'll cut your cars down to the same 20 percent so we have a balance. So. All you have to do all you have to do and if you think that Hillary. Or Jeb. Or Scott Walker in all fairness we'll be able to negotiate with Japan you're wrong you're wrong. It just doesn't happen. You know it's like why is Jack Nicklaus a great golfer.","He can't even explain it. Nobody knows really why just gets something in your gut. Why are the great baseball players great why do they hit they asked Babe Ruth hit more home runs one year than the entire league pretty good. Right. And people would go up to Babe Ruth and then say Babe babe How do you hit the long ball.","And I'd say I don't know man I just swing at it. It's called talent. Talent. Well you know a business person a good one like me. But a good one. And some of the people in the audience by the way. And you know what I'm talking about I mean a good one. Just you make deals. I mean I buy things like Doral. I bought Doral.","Hundreds of acres in the middle of Miami goes up. I don't know goes up. I mean I make good deals. I could get other guys there are other guys great deals great deal makers. We don't use them. We use Carolyn Kennedy in Japan. Excuse me. She couldn't believe she got the job. They said Would you like the jobs he said really.","But she has to be good. My daughter Ivanka likes her so I think she's a nice person. When Ivanka like somebody you ever hear of Ivanka and so what we want we want people. And I tell it all the time. I know people the greatest negotiators in the world they know. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.","I know people that you've never heard of that are better than all of that's what we need negotiating for us. Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn't happen to dinner they're vicious. They're crude. They're unhappy they treat everybody badly who cares. I want them negotiating against China.","You know my applause. I mean there's so many. You take a Carl Icahn. It's a friend of mine. He'd be great. I a Carl take China. We'll be do we're going to do very well. I'll get it see. I don't even have to say do this or do that. You take Henry Kravis you take Schwartzman to it there's so many great but we don't use him.","We use people that are donors. We use people that are friendly with the lobbyists. And it's a big problem for instance I read where Jeb Bush raised over one hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all that money aren't getting a lot. You're wrong and not always in favor of the United States.","You have China you have countries that have lobbyists. Yes I have countries that have lobbyists so they can make good. That's what everybody makes good deals. And here's the beauty of me I couldn't care less. I hire the lobby. I know these guys know I mean I know on I know the lobbyists I have them when I need something sometimes if I don't know myself you know I give it every.","When I was a businessman I get a lot of criticism. Oh but you gave to the Democrats. Who cares. I was a businessman. I kept everybody a U.S. senator calls me congratulate him. I you know I'd like to be totally idealistic and I largely am but the system we have is broken because a guy like Bush a guy like Walker all of these people are controlled by the people that give him the money.","It's true. When I give money I don't know if I need anything but two years later I'll call a guy. Yes Mr. Trump what can I do. Well you know I'm having a problem with this and that but we'll take care of it. I built the great business I built it very legally legitimately but our system is broken. We can't have that.","And I give the example of Ford have anybody heard me talking about the Ford plant should I do it again. Do you mind I just go because it's such a great example So Mexico's done a fantastic job. From an economic development standpoint not only with the trucks going back. I'm talking big. It's becoming the car capital of the world.","They do an amazing job because their people are very smart their leaders are very smart. And Ford announced that they going to move a lot of their workers out of this country. But in particular they're going to build one plant 2.5 billion dollars to put you embassy hey in Iowa 2.5 billion that would build a plant bigger than any field you have.","Is that right 2.5 billion. I said wait a minute you mean two and a half million right. They said no 2.5 bit. OK. It is 2.5 billion. So they're going to build this plant to make cars. And these cars are going to be sold all up but they're going to come into the United States. No tax no nothing what means not going to have to close up in Michigan you're going to close up another place you got to build this massive plant.","And I said so why would I do if I'm president Trump would be very easy I wouldn't even call any of the people I told you about I don't have to call Carl Icahn I'd have to call anybody. I c an do this so easy. It's too easy. I deal with a phone call. I'd call the head of Ford. And say congratulations on the new plant you're building in Mexico.","I think it's a wonderful thing. Congratulations. So thank you very much Mr. President. Let me give you the bad news. Every single car and truck and part that comes into the United States we're going to tax you 35 percent. Now. Now here's what's going to happen. He says hey Mr. President Mr. President you can't do that.","Mr. President I don't care about him. I care about the country I care about the country applause. So he's going to say you can't do this you just can't do this. It's too late. We saw this it's okay. Good luck. Build your plant. I don't care. But you're not going to rip off this country. You're just not going to do it. We want jobs in the United States.","So a hundred percent. This isn't like ninety nine point nine percent. This is 100 percent here's what's going to happen. He'll call me back probably that afternoon but he may play tough and call me the next day. Does that make sense right. He may want to be done in the meantime I will have been called by different people in Washington some of whom I know but they don't give me any money I don't care about him I couldn't care less I couldn't care less.","And many of them work for me they work for me and they'll say Mr. President you know what you did with Ford is really not good. I mean they've been wonderful thing. You know there's no way I went to the Wharton School of Finance I was a really good student I know getting good for the United States right.","So these you know all of this stuff I say look I want it here. And the next day I'll get a call from the head of Ford. He'll give me one more pitch and I'll say Mr. President we've decided not to build that plant. They were going to build it in the United St ates. That's what's gonna happen. That's what's going to happen.","Now let me explain sir. That's 100 percent. I mean my only question is will it be that day or the following day. OK. That's what happens. Hundred percent. And I would make my own phone call I'd check ethics first of all. But I guess I can't be guilty of anything if I'm not doing like I don't know you know with this crazy laws now you can be guilty if you do something that's good for the United States.","You know it's a little bit tough. So check ethics. I may have to have somebody else make the call but I'll probably be able to make it myself. I have good lawyers. So what happens. So what happens I said to myself OK that's me. I say get him back Sorry I don't want to be lobbyist save me the donor see me everybody sees me I said I don't need your money I never took any of your money.","You have no control. Bye bye. Now here's what happens with President Walker. Who's state by the way is a disaster but I won't say that. Here's what happens. And I'll tell her about that second. Something happened today which was n ot nice or President Bush or President Hillary Clinton if she makes it. No. Well it's all the same to be honest with you.","It's a system. It's all the same. So they may be I mean these aren't stupid people. So they probably know that building a two and a half billion dollar plant in Mexico is not exactly the best thing that can happen to us. So they may even say let's stop that. They will be bombarded by their lobbyists that donated a lot of money to them again.","Jeb raised one hundred and seven million dollars so far. OK then putting that money up because it's like a wonderful charity although it is a charity but not for this country for other countries. They're putting that money away so their lobbyists their special interests and their donors will start calling President Bush President Clinton President Walker pretty much whoever is president.","Other than me other than me they'll say you have to do it. They can't. They gave you a million dollars to your campaign. And this one gave you five and this one you have no. You have to do it. You know what he's gonna say OK how to hire and the plant will be built in Mexico. And we just lots lots of plants all over our country.","Okay that's what's going to happen. And folks this isn't like maybe it's 100 percent this 100 percent and then the same thing happens in China. Japan is back. You know they have a really good leader smart cutting the hell out of the yen making it possible for us to compete. People are rotting Komatsu tractors now instead of Caterpillar tractors capacity.","Japan is back big lake big leg. You people know you are in the farmers as you know what I'm talking about. They're big league ordering stuff made in Japan because they've so cut their currency they've devalue their currency so quickly. Now China is an A student one currency devaluation in the history of the world there's nobody that plays with currency better than China.","And Obama has no clue here. Honestly I don't think he has a clue. I don't think. In fact in that stupid trade bill they didn't even talk about currency devaluation. And they called me up. They want to know if I'd get support if I were to pass it. Well then number one economic power. Is devaluation. What do you say about it. Nothing.","We don't talk. They said that that's their power. It's not publicity that power is exactly that. It's currency devaluation and they're genius at it and we're not. And by the way our dollars going up you know it sounds good. Our dollar is going up. Sounds good. Strong Dollar. Except for one probably kind of any business.","That's the problem. Somebody like Obama hears Oh it's a strong dollar. Oh that's great except we lose all our business. It's great for me. I can buy property all over Europe I can buy it so cheap I bought done back in Ireland. I. Scott I'm all over the place. I bought the great Turnberry. They're having the Women's British Open at my place Turnberry one of the great resorts of the world what are the great golf courses of the world.","I bought it. I bought it. And you know what. Here's the problem. Next week we have the women's British Open one of the greatest majors in the world. I don't even know if I'm gonna be there. Do you think I'm going to be allowed to take two days off and just go for two days and see should I or not. Or should I say.","No. I know my people say oh can you stay here and make more speeches. I said Can I just go see for two days two or four days. I mean you know. So anyway but it's a Turnberry. But you know you can buy over there because the dollar and what's happening with all of the other currencies. And let me tell you.","I mean there are certain good things about a strong dollar. But mostly it's going to suck us dry. It's gonna be a real problem and you can see it. And I know you people are saying it you're seeing it big league in this world in this business. So we go and we have people and we can make our country so strong through negotiation and you know the Chinese have a lot of respect for me. Made a lot of money on a big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco.","Nobody knows and nobody knows what I young you know I have these guys maybe is not worth 10 billion I think he's only worth seven. Actually worth more than ten. But you know that's. Remember they said he'll never file. They said he'll never run. These guys they're arrogant you know they call him The Walking heads.","You know the political pundits they're arrogant people the terrible and you know the ones that hit me the hardest are the conservative ones the liberals like me better than the craziest thing and I have nothing liberal going about me. I think they like my style better. You know it's funny but the walking hits so they say he'll never run ever ever.","You know with such confidence then I announce I'm running. They say oh well he'll never say I'll sign his paper. You know it's a single page which sort of says you know you're putting up your life expecting to sign they'll never sign his FEC paper. I signed the paper. So. They say. Well putting yourself on the line.","Applause. I feel guilty with these folks. How's my hair look back. You know it is. It is my hair. I take more up use I had a story recently was so good they say is a financial genius everybody said they. He was the worst hairpiece I've ever seen. I'm saying I can't even give the sort anybody and it's not true anyway.","So they said he'll never ever in a million years signed his papers and then they say oh he'll never put in his financials so I have these counts are paying a lot of money. I have these counties all over the place because I think it's 98 pages of sums. Largest one of a found the largest numbers ever filed and I put that in. They don't know what to say.","They don't know what to do. They have no idea what to do. And they thought I wouldn't file because they said well he's probably not as rich as people think. But then it turned out I was much richer. Now they don't know what they really screwed up much Richard fact. I'm so proud. I'm unlike Mitt Romney. You know he ran from it and his numbers were peanuts in all fairness.","But but I was very disappointed because he joked I mean he I don't know something happened to him that last month month and a half. I don't want his endorsement. Believe me I will get it. But but he choked that last month and a half he was a disaster. I said to Mitt why aren't you on television. Obama say what you want about Obama.","He was on Jay Leno. He was on David Letterman was all over the place. I said Where are you. And he wasn't there. So he choked you know like. An athlete. Sometimes they choke and that's bad. But I put the numbers in I put the papers in and then I go. And now people think I'm hurt because you know nobody thought I was running.","Because they listen to these people. So now people say he's running and then the polls start coming out because you know when I'm not running it's different. Let me ask you question to you because you look so friendly stand up fo r a second before you with the glasses handsome guy stand up. When. Before you thought I was running you wouldn't give me a poll because you say hey Trump's great I love Trump at all that somebody's not going to run I'm not going away.","Right. But after I run it's a different story. Now you like Trump is that right. You better believe it's I pick the right guy. Thank you. Thank you. See that's a very dangerous thing to do because it could be. He's not a jump fan and then the whole day is over. Right. Thank you. That was great. So. The polls now coming out kind of just killing everybody.","I'm even like surprised and a lot of people are surprised and the biggest people are calling me saying this is a movement as we said and it's just a great feeling and the feeling is. And then they say oh here's the new one. Well he's having a good time. He's having a good time. If you think this I mean I love you people I love Iowa but it's hot as hell in this room I'm sweating like a dog.","Applause and I could be doing something else right now. I mean honestly he's having a good time. He'll eventually leave the race. Why. I've already had Macy's which is a terrible company with chicken. I'm just a chicken company guy was a good friend of mine and he let me down. And you know why he let me down because I want to stop illegal immigration.","So they got angry and it was peanuts anyway. It wasn't a big deal. But I just hate to say. And by the way so many people are boycotting Macy's. It's I love it. I love it. I love it because that's what's wrong with our country. People are afraid to do the right thing. They're afraid. Then I heard I was losing NASCAR headlines all over the world.","And I friend a friend called me from Paris France. Oh Don it's too bad about NASCAR. You know they have these headlines Trump and NASCAR to sever their over want illegal immigration sever relationships. He said How big a deal was it. I said they rented my ballroom for an evening. That was the deal they read.","And I'm going to rent it to somebody else hopefully for more and keep their deposit. That's what they be. That was the. Then the next day headlines all over the world. You saw it. ESPN does sever ties with Trump. I get calls from my friends Oh my. Donald so bad you're taking such a beating you're taking such a terrible beating.","And you know what that was that was a golf outing in Los Angeles on a wonderful course along the ocean. That's fantastic. So now they're going to a third rate course and they're not very happy. And by the way they all say don't worry Donald will be back next year. That's that's the way life works. So I'll just tell you I'm on the plane and I see this vicious twinkle I've been nice to Scott Walker and you know he's a nice guy.","He came up to my office like three 4 months ago presented me with a plaque because I helped him with his election. I like that he was fighting. You know at least I didn't know what the hell he was doing. But he was fighting and I like a fighter. Does that make sense. So. I've been very nice to him. But he brings me this beautiful plaque.","I don't know who pays for it does he pay for that or does Wisconsin pay for it. I don't know but it's beautiful. And I'm being very nice to him. And then today I read this horrible. Statement from his fundraiser about Trump I said Oh finally I can attack. Finally finally I would have never done this. I didn't know because I hear I'm the only one beating me in Iowa is Scott Walker not by that much.","And he grew up you know he grew up next door. I mean he's like great. Next a little advantage right. Except Wisconsin's doing terribly. It's first of all it's in turmoil. The roads are a disaster because they don't have any money to rebuild them. They're borrowing money like crazy. They projected a one billion dollar surplus and instead of a one build I wrote this stuff all down.","Although I need because I've a really good memory but they projected a 1 billion dollar surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of two point two billion dollars. And money all over the place. It's the schools are a disaster and they're fighting like crazy because there's no money for the schools the hospitals and education is a disaster.","And he was totally in favor of Common Core. Did you know that he was totally in favor of it which I hate. I heard you got to educate your children from Iowa not some bureaucrat in Washington making one hundred thousand I mean you gotta do something that to me I don't get. I mean Bush is totally in favor of Common Core now with Bush.","I'll give him one thing. He stuck with it. No way I'd rather have it stick with it because he stuck where he's still at it. Scott Walker changed what he saw he was getting creamed. So he changed so now he's not here but he was strongly in favor of Common Core and their interests they borrowed so much money that a big portion of their budget now is paying for it. So what he's doing is kicking it down the road and he's the only guy that's ahead of me and I can't believe I'm in second place I finally am in second place to Iowa but he is next to it but folks you please put me in first place so I feel better.","APPLAUSE So we had the illegal immigration. And last week it became heavy heavy heavy with our incompetent leaders in Washington. I hate to use the word leader because they're not leaders are competent politicians in Washington and it really turned into a battle for the veterans because nobody fights harder for the veteran s and me I built with a small group the Vietnam Memorial in Manhattan.","Believe me and I got a lot of credit for it and I put up the money so years ago and I tell this story you know I put up a lot of money and got worked hard with a very good small group of people and we built the Vietnam Memorial because they were never treated properly especially from Vietnam. They would never treated properly and I'm not so innocent or it but I felt this is something I can do. This is my wheelhouse.","This is what I do. I'm good at that. I'm good at money and I'm good at building things right. Does that make sense. I might not be a great soldier. I don't know maybe I would maybe I wouldn't but I'll tell you I am good at this. And we built this gorgeous. And I've done many things like that Wollman Skating Rink in Central Park so many different things but never has any group of people thanked me. So off.","And this was years ago. This was a long time ago but every time I see a vet eat an especially a V ietnam vet they say Mr. Trump thank you for the memorial. Nobody else. Everything else I do people forgotten it's gone it's gone. Short memories. But the Vietnam Memorial is like something I'm very proud of. And it's beautiful right on the East River.","I mean it is really beautiful. Looking at one of my buildings actually but I didn't build it for that right because I didn't even own the building at that time. So that's good. But. I'm very proud of that. But people they just say they love it. They thank me thank me thank me and everyone else forgets. So I've been fighting hard for the vets because the vets are being treated like third class citizens in this country and there are best therapists and when I came here when I came here today they said we have literally seven or eight in one day hundreds.","I don't even know what the number is hundreds many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets thanking me. Don't can you bring them up just bring them up if you have them. You have them somep lace. Where are they. Oh here they are. Wow. Oh wow. APPLAUSE Look look at this. This is this is from veterans. These each page different letter.","This is one day we have so many and each one. It's amazing. Each one is a separate. Each one of these letters. This is one day. This took place over the last two weeks I've been fighting like hell. And each one of these is a story about what a disaster the Veteran's Administration is. It is the most corrupt group of people in all of Washington.","And the politicians. The politicians in Washington are dishonest and or incompetent. But there is nothing like worse that happens to our vets. And I mean I could show you back as back in the office we actually have now offices in Iowa would have a great group of people great group. Chuck is here someplace and staff and we have great people.","But you know they said that back in the office you can multiply this times ten times ten. This is less than a day. So. And these are letters of horrible stories and horrible complaints. The waiting list as of last Wednesday was longer than a waiting list has ever been in the history of the V.A. the waiting list to see a doctor.","OK. I mean. Who can do b etter than Trump. I fix things. I get things to work. I manage an so we'll wrap it up but I will say this. Look you have to understand we have a country. And my slogan I actually marked it up with copyright it. Can you believe because other people were using my slogan. They see I get by the way I get the biggest crowds I get the biggest standing ovations.","Everybody knows that the press never reports it and the press doesn't understand that there's a room like this in another part of the building where it's packed also with its closed circuit. You people did better with real estate than they did but that's OK because I'm going oh I'm going over to see them right after this to say hello but they're hearing what we're saying.","But the press is very dishonest the political press you know I've dealt with the financial press and you know look maybe it's simple because it's numbers you have that you have it you don't have maybe it's simple but. And by the way a lot of the a lot of the political press is great like 30 35 percent but some is so dishonest you'll have a meeting like this and the same the crowd was minuscule.","Somebody said this the largest crowd they've ever had in Iowa here the whole thing. I mean that's what I've heard. I don't know but they'll say Mr. Trump spoke in front of a crowd you know record crowds. Mr. Trump spoke in front of a crowd. That is so dishonest it's so terrible. And you know one of the things I say is that I have an expression I used a lot in speeches.","The American Dream is dead but I'm gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. OK. I mean I say that. APPLAUSE I say that. APPLAUSE And I say it a lot. The American Dream is dead and I'm gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. So I go home I see my wife and you know all my speeches alive.","It's like the like when CNN LIVE ON FOX It's life. How do you like to do this you're always live on television and if you make one little mistake they'll say oh it's terrible. I'm on life everyone else. They don't even have cameras you know the other candidates they come there's no cameras with me all my life.","My wife called up. Darling you live all over the world. I say Oh that's great. That makes me feel great. But you know what. I could do without it. I could do without it. So I say that the American dream is dead going to make it bigger. OK. So she said Darling that was terrible what you said today what you said the American dream is dead.","I said no no but I'm going to make it. No no you didn't say that. You should have said that. Since should turn it on. You know the TiVo stuff right. I say turn it on. Let me see. And it has to be the American dream is dead click. And next subject and I go Whoa. Whoa that's bad right. No I go to like man.","That's terrible. She was upset with me. She said Why didn't you say it properly. I said I did. So they have the America because you know how bad a statement that is. So the people in the room loved it but the people in the television didn't get to hear but make America great again. So I actually copyright it because I'm using that a lot and I think it's a great statement.","I think it's a great statement. And all of the candidates have you know different statements. You know one of them has I think rise. I'm saying excuse me. Whose is that. Who's his rise. They have rise. Who's that. Who came up with the rise. That's not good. Probably paid a million dollars to some guy you know to come up with that one.","No but I love to copyright it. So I actually won the copyright I got a cup. I didn't even know I could do that. Good lawyers. I have very good I'm very good with contracts don't you want that. Or do you want. You know a woman got up because I actually think I'm a nice guy I love people I have lots of fun in life.","I've been great at what I do I've had big success I went to the best school I was a good student I got out I built a fortune I had a book The Art of the deal which everybody read probably right. Oh it's right there. Look at them. So so but it was a you know I guess the number one selling business book of all time.","I do the show called The Apprentice. It becomes a big hit. Let's see how well it does without Trump. You know I told NBC I'm not doing it. They were angry at me. They came to my office. They had people from NBC and Comcast just before I announced they came to my office to see if I would not announce would I do the apprentice.","And you know it's big it's a lot of money. Hey did you see. I put down two hundred and thirteen million dollars. That's what I made from the Apprentice. And you had some clowns on top. There's no way. And then I said I'll tell you what I'll bet a year's salary your salary not my salad because they made a mistake.","I would. If you're right I'll pay you for yourself if you're wrong. We'll split it. You'll do it the other way right. So then I found out I was right. All right. Two hundred. So when I won I do you know when I say I'm not doing it. Ma rk Burnett called me good guy. He did the apprentice survivor you know.","He said Donald you're turning down an extension nobody to let me tell you what I'm giving up not only there. But what I'm giving up in deals that I'm not done. It's here somebody said well how much will that campaign cost that's peanuts compared to what I'm giving up. That's peanuts. The campaign is my my smallest cause I'm doing it to make America great again.","That's all. So what happened is a number of people started using that phrase and we actually can you believe this. I sent them legal as you know they were saying and will but they don't say it like I do. They will make America great again. Everyone says just another politician is not going to happen. We will make deals that are so good with foreign countries.","Remember this we're being drained. We're being fleeced. We're being fleeced. The Iran deal. Twenty four days to go and think of that. You know it's funny. I love the idea of a nuclear deal but we got to do it from strength. We should have put the sanctions on double and triple and made the real deal not and not have a guy like Barak as not had a guy like Tony I mean I watched him on television the other day I said Is he right.","Is he right. He's trying to justify 24 days. So first before you get to the 24 days it's a long process OK. You say we're going to do. They're going to fight you. That is probably take who knows how long it took. Then when the when it starts 20 by that time they can move all they can move whatever they want.","They'll go Oh there are no missiles here. You know six months. Oh no this is lovely. Oh. They're so honorable. You know the Iranians is a great people and they are smart. They're great negotiators you know the Persians are great negotiators but there are two things we could talk about the accelerators we could talk about the feel we can talk about a lot that a lot of it you know I had an uncle who is great up at M.I.T. Dr. John Trump really smart guy.","He said well you can do with this stuff. So they have all this period of time all this period of time. But there are two things that you can not ever justify. One is 24 days. And remember this is much longer because before that time limits such a whole process. So one is twenty four days can't be sold. Nobody can sell it. Why isn't it like immediate.","You know they say anywhere any place etc. anytime. But why isn't it immediate. Why is it the media so you can't. So I'll tell you what the other thing you can't sell hostages. We'll get four people over of them and I guess you could say the third thing is a hundred and fifty billion dollars that we give them.","So they are going to be I mean if they were a stock I would buy so much of Iran right now. I would do you know how good I did with picking stocks. You see that all those stocks went up I think 48 out of 50 is very good even though it's not even my business. I don't do stocks for the most part but I just looked and I said you know what it's like let's do some of this.","And I was proud to do it in fact I sold them because I wanted people to see and they saw I had a great record. What was it like forty seven out of 52 or 51 went up. Well if I were a stock picker if I were a country picker you got to pick Iran because what we have done is we have made them a tremendous power an extraordinarily rich country think of it. We're giving them one hundred and fifty billion and much more.","They're going to end up with nuclear. You're going to start. A nuclear revolution. People are going to you wait till you see what happens now with other countries. Israel is devastated as they should be. Israel has been hurt. I mean I don't get it. I have friends of mine that are Jewish that contribute to Obama and I say and smart people.","I say What are you doing. What are you doing. It doesn't make sense. I don't understand it but Israel is going to be. I mean this is a real problem for Israel and it's a real problem for us. And then you see today I don't know. Did you see that the picture of Obama with a gun to his head was a caricature of Obama.","Where the supreme leader. I see on NBC the other day they said the supreme leader not my supreme leader don't call him the supreme leader. It's a great term. That's like a term that Trump would use supreme leader. That's right. He like my supreme leader. So don't use that term say the leader of Iran. Don't say the supreme they say the supreme leader.","And he said today or yesterday big big thing in the papers it says Don't mess with us don't mess with us. And you know the chief negotiator who I watched on television and as soon as I saw him I sai d this guy Kerry cannot deal with him cannot deal with him. It's a different level it's like the New England Patriots playing my high school football team.","That's what it's like. That's what it's like. And you can't deal with them and you have to see you. I mean it's so devastating to see what happened. But the three things the money. OK. And then the other two things. Twenty four days. And why don't we get. So they said about the president's. This I mean. They said we didn't want to talk about the prisoners because it would complicate the negotiations.","Think of this. You know what it is we will feathers we want our prisoners back before we start give them back to give it. If you have the right messenger there are people in this room could do a good. There are people who I would do a great walk in fellas before we start this should have been done before we start not at the end.","We should have it done before this should have been done. I mean I call it the world's longest negotiation . OK just one no forever and we just kept giving up giving up giving up would say we'd like this. No. Oh how about this. No. We have nothing. But if you went in right at the beginning so here's the story.","First of all you should have increased the sanctions have done or would have been very easy actually. That would have been almost as easy as it may be easier. But. But you say right at the beginning fellas no women in the room Sadly they haven't figured that one out that the women are smarter than the men but that's OK they'll figure it out.","In about one hundred and fifty years they'll figure it out. You say fellas you don't want him. You don't need him. We need him up here. It'll be good for the deal. Let the prisoners out right now. Please let him out. Come on. Don't do it. We don't even ask. And then I see Kerry and Obama on television the other day saying it was too complicated too complicated.","And yet according to certain papers a couple of years ago we gave them a nuclear sci entist. Does anyone even know that we gave them a nuclear scientist right. It's hard to believe how incompetent our country is run. So as so it's an honor to be with you and I will tell you if I'm elected president we will.","And very quickly make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much."],"text":" You know, thank you very much. Wow what a lot of welcome. It's a terrific place. Terrific. We just got in and we were driving. I'm driving through these beautiful fields I want to grab that corn like you've never seen so rich so beautiful. And thank you for being here on a Saturday. I know you can be doing a lot of other I mean we have such a huge crowd. We have another room that's packed like this one and people standing outside. They I don't know we can let them in if we can put them up but we had so many people standing outside. I just want to thank you. And actually the Des Moines Register is standing outside to us some. Sort of funny. So it was sort of funny. So you know it's a super liberal rag not respected around here but they come out with an editorial. Mr. Trump I'm rated number one now in every poll because you know what people are tired of what's gone up because of me get tired and they said so you number one in every poll and they say you should drop your candidacy I say Excuse me. I mean you know why. But it's such an honor to be here and to discuss some of the things that taken place over the last week. This has been a big week. First of all Hillary is now officially under investigation for the emails. Big big you know if you look at it. Look I don't think anything's going to happen to her because it's all Democrats that are doing the investigation. I mean. It's the way it is. Right. And. You look at you look at the prosecutors are all Democrats and they want jobs and they want to continue onward. And. You know the attorney general is a Democrat right. Oh that's different. I agree with that. But I say you have all of these people and it's just a game that goes on in Washington it's terrible what's going on and you look at General Petraeus as an example so he was a general did a very good job although I don't know you know that whole thing is such a disaster with what's going. But he did a good job and he was a respected guy and he did much less than Hillary much less in terms of information in terms of importance in terms of volume. I mean he gave a little bit. You talked about years and years and thousands of emails and they destroyed his life. His life is over. They've destroyed him. He's like a ruined man. I saw him. He's like a ruined demand. And. With Hillary she's supposed to be running and she's favored to win not against me she's not favorite. I'll tell you that. But she's favorite to win. So. Look if the prosecutors are honorable. And they may be if they're fair if they're just sadly bad stuff has to happen because what she did is very criminal and very serious and it's too bad it's too bad. And I don't I don't know how a person with that cloud over their head actually can be running for the office of president. You know you wouldn't think so. So we'll see what happens it'll be very interesting. And you don't hear that talk from other politicians it's almost like they have you know even these Republican guys that I'm running against it's like you're not going to hear that. You know they protect each other because they say that could be them. That could be this. I've got to take it easy I don't want to me I don't care. I say the truth. So I went to Laredo and my wife came home and she was crying and I said to myself why are you crying. You made it home You made it safely from the border. She was crying tears were coming down her face because she thought it was so dangerous. And I said to myself she either really loves me a lot or she's got a pretty good line of stuff going OK. But it was a little bit you know scary going over the border. And while I was there and by the way I have to tell you the mayor. Pete great guy really great guy and he's a Democrat but he's a great guy. And they gave us such good treatment. The law enforcement there is unbelievable including the Border Patrol. You know they were told as I was in the air from Washington don't be there for Trump DON'T BE FOR TRUMP They're the ones that invited me the Border Patrol. They're incredible people. And they were told in that area which you'd call a local. But there are hundreds or actually thousands of border patrol guys and women tremendous people like the people I just met outside some of the law enforcement people the sheriff some of these people are great. I'm not going to mess with them it's true. No I looked at some of these people outside I said you know what. Nobody's messing with me today. Not with them. But. But when I went there I saw you know the mayor couldn't have been nicer. I saw the city manager Hey Suze great guy. And they gave me a whole big tour of a lot of different things. And the Border Patrol people were told not to be there from Washington. They were told from Washington. I wonder who told them I won't. But they said don't be there. And you know by the end of the trip many many Border Patrol people came to see me anyway. I mean they actually disobeyed orders then I actually made a third stop that wasn't anticipated right by the airport. And I spoke to law enforcement and a lot of the Border Patrol. The reason they wanted me to be there. You know it's pretty simple especially down in the valley. It's really dangerous. It's really really dangerous. There's the border. Remember I made the statement about Mexico is sending in people who come in every year so what a horrible thing. Well now I've been I have journalists calling me up I have people calling me up saying We apologize. I was right. And then And then of course you had Kate beautiful Kate incredible family the mother the father the brother Brad. They're incredible people I spoke to him and you have these people and they are living in hell. They lost this incredible person shot as you know the story very well shot by an illegal immigrant that came over. Had to know he was forced over or he came over five times and then the fifth time was disastrous for a family and for a country frankly. And Jamiel the football player. Young boy incredible father Jamiel Shaw who I got to know. Unbelievable kid. And he was coming home he's walking home from the deli. A few minutes away from the house and his father tells the staff I everybody even the reporters I knew some hard veteran reporters and there's tears coming down their eyes we had a conference in California a couple of weeks ago with six families who lost their children to illegal immigrants. It's a big problem. Such a big problem. And nobody wants to talk about it. Suc h a big problem in the case of Jamiel applying to Stanford. Excellent player good student. Incredible parents and father who I got to know the father really well and he was five minutes away and this guy just walks up to him and shoots him and after he's down he takes a gun and shoots him again and he didn't do anything fact he called his father because his father affectionately like my kids he said old man he used to call a moment old man I'll be home in about four minutes and right after that a minute later the father heard a shot and he said Oh no no that can't be and his son was laying there shot by. An animal an animal that shouldn't have been in this country and people coming across the border coming from many places not just Mexico I mean they're coming from many places and you know they tried to put on Mexico I love the Mexican people I have such a great eye. Thousands of people over the years thousands of people from Mexico from all over Hispanics that worked for me. They'r e incredible people they work hard they're great people. And Mexico is a country I respect and I've said this. The problem is that their leaders are too smart too cunning they're just better. They negotiate better. They're tougher. They're much smarter than our leaders our leaders are dummies. They don't know what's happening. It's true. No they're incompetent. They're incompetent. Along with our sanctuary cities nobody even heard the term. And frankly I hate to brag. If it wasn't for me you would still never have heard of the word sanctuary city. I hate to tell you that and you know things that we never even heard about. And what's happening is there's a movement going on folks. You know there's a movement going on and it's a very strong movement. We want to take back this country. We have to take it back. We have to take it. APPLAUSE AND Baxley one of the very big reporters call me and actually use the word movement because as you know they just came out the economist just kept very highly respected business magazine very respected poll and they just came out and I think I'm at 28 and Walker is at 14. And we'll talk about Walker in a second because that's the whole big story but Walker's at 14. I think Bush's at 13 28 and saying what's going on some movement. I'm telling you so. So when I was in Laredo I met some incredible people and I'm watching and I'm watching thousands and thousands of trucks and buses and cars. Basically it's a gate. It's a gateway into Mexico. And I asked people that were their experts because they were giving me like a whole big Charette. And I asked some of the people said so let me guess because I was looking at these cars just flowing and trucks flowing into Mexico. And again I respect Mexico for this. I like Mexico for this. I just wish our leaders were the same. I'm not knocking them. I don't not China because they outsmart our country. They make we rebuilt China with the money they drained out of our country. We rebuilt it. That doesn't mean you know the largest bank in the world is my tenant. How could I dislike China. They pay me a lot of money. Through Chinese bank. The biggest so much bigger. I said How does it compare to Citibank. That is like a small subsidiary. That's what they told a small subsidiary. Now I have the lar gest bank in the world I sell millions and millions of dollars. I mean when I sell a condo for 25 million to a man from China for 45 million for 30 million for 10 million for 5 million to China am I going to dislike them I love them but their leaders are much smarter than our latest. Same thing with Mexico where they make a fortune. And I respect that people said I don't like Mex I love Mexico. I just want our country to be well represented. You know free trade is a good thing. But the one problem with free trade is you have to have really smart leaders and you have have to have great negotiators because what being killed were being killed in negotiation so while I was at Laredo I noticed something very unusual I said. Number one I saw that traffic was so massive and it was so nice to me they stopped the traffic for while I'm there to do me a favor let those poor people go. They said no no we want to stop. Let them go. They go into Mexico to spend money. But here's what happened. So while whether you probably read it it was in Drudge who's great by the way Drudge is amazing. But the story on Drudge and big stories all over the place now guys swimming across in big bags of stuff trucks swimming across the river right. Swimming right across. And they put the drugs and actually the camera crew or the reporters were. Petrified because they thought they were gonna be killed. Because they have chosen this on camera. The guys carrying bags of stuff. It was drugs. And then ABC the big one I always got ABC at 630 but the big one. And they have their cameras are setting up and two guys go running by. And there are two other people running behind them trying to catch them from the water this and this is the g ood part of the border because as they say oh the valley is much you know the Valley is that's trouble. And I saw something that was amazing. I said to let me see the drugs come through. And what goes back cash. Oh so Mexico has the best of all worlds again out of respect. The drugs come through and the cash goes back to Mexico. So we get the worst of two ends. We lose our cash and we have drugs all over the country. How stupid a way how stupid. Think of how stupid applause so that wouldn't happen with me. Believe me that won't happen with me. And we have you know sometimes you say sometime and it was a great experience for me. I mean told the pilots I said fly a little bit away from the border please just you know go fly a little bit inland. But it's a whole scary thing. You know when you're afraid to walk into your own country. Pretty bad. Hard to believe. You don't have that problem in Iowa and offer it is but it's pretty rough out there. But think of it. So the drugs come in. We get the drugs bad stuff. The cash goes out. But I mean so we get it but so it's got to be straightened out. We need a border. It's got to be strong combination of walls combinations of fence combinations of great Border Patrol. These people are great. The reason they wanted to meet me is because they want to explain how bad it was. That's all. They didn't like the way I look they liked what I said. And many of the families that testified last week before Congress whose children were killed. I was so honored but more honored than just about anything I've done. They said if it weren't for Donald Trump nobody would even know how serious this problem is I was so honored almost all of them said. Applause. So we need borders. We have to stop illegal immigration. And by the way immigration is a great thing. Illegal immigration is a great thing. And maybe we should speed up the process. We should definitely speed up the process. And we should take people in that a great people sort of a merit system. You know when I went to school I had like a marriage. We did good didn't you know we felt good we got an A. We got to be we got to see whatever we got but we don't have anything. We just have people flowing in and staying and in some cases they're not people that Mexico wants because they say why should we take these people that are rough. Why should we take the certain people that are rough and put them in our prisons when the extremely dumb politicians in the United States will put them in their prisons or worse or worse will not put them in prison at all. Well let them just roam around shooting people and killing people. OK. So then we have another thing happened this week the Iran deal. OK. You know I say I sometimes start speeches by saying we don't win anymore in this country. What a win. What was the last time we won. What a win. When did we beat China in a trade deal. We don't win. When do we beat Japan. I mean Japan sends as millions of cars I was in Los Angeles this week I looked at some of these boats. They're the biggest boats I've been around I've seen boats the biggest boats I've ever seen. They're sending us millions of cars. We send them in all due respect weak. Not a good trade. I love we. It's wonderful. But I'd rather be sending the cars in the way. Does it make sense to you folks. We send them cattle and in many cases as you know you've been reading they won't take our cattle because the farmers don't want it. They're always fighting to get it in. And yet they drop millions and millions of cars. So I heard that the stat is about let's say we're 100 percent over here and we're under 20 pe rcent over here. So we're sending 19 20 percent and not as profitable stuff because it's very perishable. So we're very expensive to transport was a car you put it on the boat and it goes right. So you get you. We're sending them very perishable stuff here. That's 20 percent. They're sending us automobiles that we have up. To our gills. So that's over here. Right. And I said to myself so easy. All you have to do is say hey look you won't take our cattle you won't take our wheat you won't take anything you don't want it because you say the farmers don't want. OK I understand that but maybe we'll cut your cars down to the same 20 percent so we have a balance. So. All you have to do all you have to do and if you think that Hillary. Or Jeb. Or Scott Walker in all fairness we'll be able to negotiate with Japan you're wrong you're wrong. It just doesn't happen. You know it's like why is Jack Nicklaus a great golfer. He can't even explain it. Nobody knows really why just gets something in your gut. Why are the great baseball players great why do they hit they asked Babe Ruth hit more home runs one year than the entire league pretty good. Right. And people would go up to Babe Ruth and then say Babe babe How do you hit the long ball. And I'd say I don't know man I just swing at it. It's called talent. Talent. Well you know a business person a good one like me. But a good one. And some of the people in the audience by the way. And you know what I'm talking about I mean a good one. Just you make deals. I mean I buy things like Doral. I bought Doral. Hundreds of acres in the middle of Miami goes up. I don't know goes up. I mean I make good deals. I could get other guys there are other guys great deals great deal makers. We don't use them. We use Carolyn Kennedy in Japan. Excuse me. She couldn't believe she got the job. They said Would you like the jobs he said really. But she has to be good. My daughter Ivanka likes her so I think she's a nice person. When Ivanka like somebody you ever hear of Ivanka and so what we want we want people. And I tell it all the time. I know people the greatest negotiators in the world they know. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones. I know people that you've never heard of that are better than all of that's what we need negotiating for us. Now some of these people are horrible human beings. You wouldn't happen to dinner they're vicious. They're crude. They're unhappy they treat everybody badly who cares. I want them negotiating against China. You know my applause. I mean there's so many. You take a Carl Icahn. It's a friend of mine. He'd be great. I a Carl take China. We'll be do we're going to do very well. I'll get it see. I don't even have to say do this or do that. You take Henry Kravis you take Schwartzman to it there's so many great but we don't use him. We use people that are donors. We use people that are friendly with the lobbyists. And it's a big problem for instance I read where Jeb Bush raised over one hundred million dollars. Now if you think that those people giving him all that money aren't getting a lot. You're wrong and not always in favor of the United States. You have China you have countries that have lobbyists. Yes I have countries that have lobbyists so they can make good. That's what everybody makes good deals. And here's the beauty of me I couldn't care less. I hire the lobby. I know these guys know I mean I know on I know the lobbyists I have them when I need something sometimes if I don't know myself you know I give it every. When I was a businessman I get a lot of criticism. Oh but you gave to the Democrats. Who cares. I was a businessman. I kept everybody a U.S. senator calls me congratulate him. I you know I'd like to be totally idealistic and I largely am but the system we have is broken because a guy like Bush a guy like Walker all of these people are controlled by the people that give him the money. It's true. When I give money I don't know if I need anything but two years later I'll call a guy. Yes Mr. Trump what can I do. Well you know I'm having a problem with this and that but we'll take care of it. I built the great business I built it very legally legitimately but our system is broken. We can't have that. And I give the example of Ford have anybody heard me talking about the Ford plant should I do it again. Do you mind I just go because it's such a great example So Mexico's done a fantastic job. From an economic development standpoint not only with the trucks going back. I'm talking big. It's becoming the car capital of the world. They do an amazing job because their people are very smart their leaders are very smart. And Ford announced that they going to move a lot of their workers out of this country. But in particular they're going to build one plant 2.5 billion dollars to put you embassy hey in Iowa 2.5 billion that would build a plant bigger than any field you have. Is that right 2.5 billion. I said wait a minute you mean two and a half million right. They said no 2.5 bit. OK. It is 2.5 billion. So they're going to build this plant to make cars. And these cars are going to be sold all up but they're going to come into the United States. No tax no nothing what means not going to have to close up in Michigan you're going to close up another place you got to build this massive plant. And I said so why would I do if I'm president Trump would be very easy I wouldn't even call any of the people I told you about I don't have to call Carl Icahn I'd have to call anybody. I c an do this so easy. It's too easy. I deal with a phone call. I'd call the head of Ford. And say congratulations on the new plant you're building in Mexico. I think it's a wonderful thing. Congratulations. So thank you very much Mr. President. Let me give you the bad news. Every single car and truck and part that comes into the United States we're going to tax you 35 percent. Now. Now here's what's going to happen. He says hey Mr. President Mr. President you can't do that. Mr. President I don't care about him. I care about the country I care about the country applause. So he's going to say you can't do this you just can't do this. It's too late. We saw this it's okay. Good luck. Build your plant. I don't care. But you're not going to rip off this country. You're just not going to do it. We want jobs in the United States. So a hundred percent. This isn't like ninety nine point nine percent. This is 100 percent here's what's going to happen. He'll call me back probably that afternoon but he may play tough and call me the next day. Does that make sense right. He may want to be done in the meantime I will have been called by different people in Washington some of whom I know but they don't give me any money I don't care about him I couldn't care less I couldn't care less. And many of them work for me they work for me and they'll say Mr. President you know what you did with Ford is really not good. I mean they've been wonderful thing. You know there's no way I went to the Wharton School of Finance I was a really good student I know getting good for the United States right. So these you know all of this stuff I say look I want it here. And the next day I'll get a call from the head of Ford. He'll give me one more pitch and I'll say Mr. President we've decided not to build that plant. They were going to build it in the United St ates. That's what's gonna happen. That's what's going to happen. Now let me explain sir. That's 100 percent. I mean my only question is will it be that day or the following day. OK. That's what happens. Hundred percent. And I would make my own phone call I'd check ethics first of all. But I guess I can't be guilty of anything if I'm not doing like I don't know you know with this crazy laws now you can be guilty if you do something that's good for the United States. You know it's a little bit tough. So check ethics. I may have to have somebody else make the call but I'll probably be able to make it myself. I have good lawyers. So what happens. So what happens I said to myself OK that's me. I say get him back Sorry I don't want to be lobbyist save me the donor see me everybody sees me I said I don't need your money I never took any of your money. You have no control. Bye bye. Now here's what happens with President Walker. Who's state by the way is a disaster but I won't say that. Here's what happens. And I'll tell her about that second. Something happened today which was n ot nice or President Bush or President Hillary Clinton if she makes it. No. Well it's all the same to be honest with you. It's a system. It's all the same. So they may be I mean these aren't stupid people. So they probably know that building a two and a half billion dollar plant in Mexico is not exactly the best thing that can happen to us. So they may even say let's stop that. They will be bombarded by their lobbyists that donated a lot of money to them again. Jeb raised one hundred and seven million dollars so far. OK then putting that money up because it's like a wonderful charity although it is a charity but not for this country for other countries. They're putting that money away so their lobbyists their special interests and their donors will start calling President Bush President Clinton President Walker pretty much whoever is president. Other than me other than me they'll say you have to do it. They can't. They gave you a million dollars to your campaign. And this one gave you five and this one you have no. You have to do it. You know what he's gonna say OK how to hire and the plant will be built in Mexico. And we just lots lots of plants all over our country. Okay that's what's going to happen. And folks this isn't like maybe it's 100 percent this 100 percent and then the same thing happens in China. Japan is back. You know they have a really good leader smart cutting the hell out of the yen making it possible for us to compete. People are rotting Komatsu tractors now instead of Caterpillar tractors capacity. Japan is back big lake big leg. You people know you are in the farmers as you know what I'm talking about. They're big league ordering stuff made in Japan because they've so cut their currency they've devalue their currency so quickly. Now China is an A student one currency devaluation in the history of the world there's nobody that plays with currency better than China. And Obama has no clue here. Honestly I don't think he has a clue. I don't think. In fact in that stupid trade bill they didn't even talk about currency devaluation. And they called me up. They want to know if I'd get support if I were to pass it. Well then number one economic power. Is devaluation. What do you say about it. Nothing. We don't talk. They said that that's their power. It's not publicity that power is exactly that. It's currency devaluation and they're genius at it and we're not. And by the way our dollars going up you know it sounds good. Our dollar is going up. Sounds good. Strong Dollar. Except for one probably kind of any business. That's the problem. Somebody like Obama hears Oh it's a strong dollar. Oh that's great except we lose all our business. It's great for me. I can buy property all over Europe I can buy it so cheap I bought done back in Ireland. I. Scott I'm all over the place. I bought the great Turnberry. They're having the Women's British Open at my place Turnberry one of the great resorts of the world what are the great golf courses of the world. I bought it. I bought it. And you know what. Here's the problem. Next week we have the women's British Open one of the greatest majors in the world. I don't even know if I'm gonna be there. Do you think I'm going to be allowed to take two days off and just go for two days and see should I or not. Or should I say. No. I know my people say oh can you stay here and make more speeches. I said Can I just go see for two days two or four days. I mean you know. So anyway but it's a Turnberry. But you know you can buy over there because the dollar and what's happening with all of the other currencies. And let me tell you. I mean there are certain good things about a strong dollar. But mostly it's going to suck us dry. It's gonna be a real problem and you can see it. And I know you people are saying it you're seeing it big league in this world in this business. So we go and we have people and we can make our country so strong through negotiation and you know the Chinese have a lot of respect for me. Made a lot of money on a big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco. Nobody knows and nobody knows what I young you know I have these guys maybe is not worth 10 billion I think he's only worth seven. Actually worth more than ten. But you know that's. Remember they said he'll never file. They said he'll never run. These guys they're arrogant you know they call him The Walking heads. You know the political pundits they're arrogant people the terrible and you know the ones that hit me the hardest are the conservative ones the liberals like me better than the craziest thing and I have nothing liberal going about me. I think they like my style better. You know it's funny but the walking hits so they say he'll never run ever ever. You know with such confidence then I announce I'm running. They say oh well he'll never say I'll sign his paper. You know it's a single page which sort of says you know you're putting up your life expecting to sign they'll never sign his FEC paper. I signed the paper. So. They say. Well putting yourself on the line. Applause. I feel guilty with these folks. How's my hair look back. You know it is. It is my hair. I take more up use I had a story recently was so good they say is a financial genius everybody said they. He was the worst hairpiece I've ever seen. I'm saying I can't even give the sort anybody and it's not true anyway. So they said he'll never ever in a million years signed his papers and then they say oh he'll never put in his financials so I have these counts are paying a lot of money. I have these counties all over the place because I think it's 98 pages of sums. Largest one of a found the largest numbers ever filed and I put that in. They don't know what to say. They don't know what to do. They have no idea what to do. And they thought I wouldn't file because they said well he's probably not as rich as people think. But then it turned out I was much richer. Now they don't know what they really screwed up much Richard fact. I'm so proud. I'm unlike Mitt Romney. You know he ran from it and his numbers were peanuts in all fairness. But but I was very disappointed because he joked I mean he I don't know something happened to him that last month month and a half. I don't want his endorsement. Believe me I will get it. But but he choked that last month and a half he was a disaster. I said to Mitt why aren't you on television. Obama say what you want about Obama. He was on Jay Leno. He was on David Letterman was all over the place. I said Where are you. And he wasn't there. So he choked you know like. An athlete. Sometimes they choke and that's bad. But I put the numbers in I put the papers in and then I go. And now people think I'm hurt because you know nobody thought I was running. Because they listen to these people. So now people say he's running and then the polls start coming out because you know when I'm not running it's different. Let me ask you question to you because you look so friendly stand up fo r a second before you with the glasses handsome guy stand up. When. Before you thought I was running you wouldn't give me a poll because you say hey Trump's great I love Trump at all that somebody's not going to run I'm not going away. Right. But after I run it's a different story. Now you like Trump is that right. You better believe it's I pick the right guy. Thank you. Thank you. See that's a very dangerous thing to do because it could be. He's not a jump fan and then the whole day is over. Right. Thank you. That was great. So. The polls now coming out kind of just killing everybody. I'm even like surprised and a lot of people are surprised and the biggest people are calling me saying this is a movement as we said and it's just a great feeling and the feeling is. And then they say oh here's the new one. Well he's having a good time. He's having a good time. If you think this I mean I love you people I love Iowa but it's hot as hell in this room I'm sweating like a dog. Applause and I could be doing something else right now. I mean honestly he's having a good time. He'll eventually leave the race. Why. I've already had Macy's which is a terrible company with chicken. I'm just a chicken company guy was a good friend of mine and he let me down. And you know why he let me down because I want to stop illegal immigration. So they got angry and it was peanuts anyway. It wasn't a big deal. But I just hate to say. And by the way so many people are boycotting Macy's. It's I love it. I love it. I love it because that's what's wrong with our country. People are afraid to do the right thing. They're afraid. Then I heard I was losing NASCAR headlines all over the world. And I friend a friend called me from Paris France. Oh Don it's too bad about NASCAR. You know they have these headlines Trump and NASCAR to sever their over want illegal immigration sever relationships. He said How big a deal was it. I said they rented my ballroom for an evening. That was the deal they read. And I'm going to rent it to somebody else hopefully for more and keep their deposit. That's what they be. That was the. Then the next day headlines all over the world. You saw it. ESPN does sever ties with Trump. I get calls from my friends Oh my. Donald so bad you're taking such a beating you're taking such a terrible beating. And you know what that was that was a golf outing in Los Angeles on a wonderful course along the ocean. That's fantastic. So now they're going to a third rate course and they're not very happy. And by the way they all say don't worry Donald will be back next year. That's that's the way life works. So I'll just tell you I'm on the plane and I see this vicious twinkle I've been nice to Scott Walker and you know he's a nice guy. He came up to my office like three 4 months ago presented me with a plaque because I helped him with his election. I like that he was fighting. You know at least I didn't know what the hell he was doing. But he was fighting and I like a fighter. Does that make sense. So. I've been very nice to him. But he brings me this beautiful plaque. I don't know who pays for it does he pay for that or does Wisconsin pay for it. I don't know but it's beautiful. And I'm being very nice to him. And then today I read this horrible. Statement from his fundraiser about Trump I said Oh finally I can attack. Finally finally I would have never done this. I didn't know because I hear I'm the only one beating me in Iowa is Scott Walker not by that much. And he grew up you know he grew up next door. I mean he's like great. Next a little advantage right. Except Wisconsin's doing terribly. It's first of all it's in turmoil. The roads are a disaster because they don't have any money to rebuild them. They're borrowing money like crazy. They projected a one billion dollar surplus and instead of a one build I wrote this stuff all down. Although I need because I've a really good memory but they projected a 1 billion dollar surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of two point two billion dollars. And money all over the place. It's the schools are a disaster and they're fighting like crazy because there's no money for the schools the hospitals and education is a disaster. And he was totally in favor of Common Core. Did you know that he was totally in favor of it which I hate. I heard you got to educate your children from Iowa not some bureaucrat in Washington making one hundred thousand I mean you gotta do something that to me I don't get. I mean Bush is totally in favor of Common Core now with Bush. I'll give him one thing. He stuck with it. No way I'd rather have it stick with it because he stuck where he's still at it. Scott Walker changed what he saw he was getting creamed. So he changed so now he's not here but he was strongly in favor of Common Core and their interests they borrowed so much money that a big portion of their budget now is paying for it. So what he's doing is kicking it down the road and he's the only guy that's ahead of me and I can't believe I'm in second place I finally am in second place to Iowa but he is next to it but folks you please put me in first place so I feel better. APPLAUSE So we had the illegal immigration. And last week it became heavy heavy heavy with our incompetent leaders in Washington. I hate to use the word leader because they're not leaders are competent politicians in Washington and it really turned into a battle for the veterans because nobody fights harder for the veteran s and me I built with a small group the Vietnam Memorial in Manhattan. Believe me and I got a lot of credit for it and I put up the money so years ago and I tell this story you know I put up a lot of money and got worked hard with a very good small group of people and we built the Vietnam Memorial because they were never treated properly especially from Vietnam. They would never treated properly and I'm not so innocent or it but I felt this is something I can do. This is my wheelhouse. This is what I do. I'm good at that. I'm good at money and I'm good at building things right. Does that make sense. I might not be a great soldier. I don't know maybe I would maybe I wouldn't but I'll tell you I am good at this. And we built this gorgeous. And I've done many things like that Wollman Skating Rink in Central Park so many different things but never has any group of people thanked me. So off. And this was years ago. This was a long time ago but every time I see a vet eat an especially a V ietnam vet they say Mr. Trump thank you for the memorial. Nobody else. Everything else I do people forgotten it's gone it's gone. Short memories. But the Vietnam Memorial is like something I'm very proud of. And it's beautiful right on the East River. I mean it is really beautiful. Looking at one of my buildings actually but I didn't build it for that right because I didn't even own the building at that time. So that's good. But. I'm very proud of that. But people they just say they love it. They thank me thank me thank me and everyone else forgets. So I've been fighting hard for the vets because the vets are being treated like third class citizens in this country and there are best therapists and when I came here when I came here today they said we have literally seven or eight in one day hundreds. I don't even know what the number is hundreds many hundreds of letters from Vietnam vets thanking me. Don't can you bring them up just bring them up if you have them. You have them somep lace. Where are they. Oh here they are. Wow. Oh wow. APPLAUSE Look look at this. This is this is from veterans. These each page different letter. This is one day we have so many and each one. It's amazing. Each one is a separate. Each one of these letters. This is one day. This took place over the last two weeks I've been fighting like hell. And each one of these is a story about what a disaster the Veteran's Administration is. It is the most corrupt group of people in all of Washington. And the politicians. The politicians in Washington are dishonest and or incompetent. But there is nothing like worse that happens to our vets. And I mean I could show you back as back in the office we actually have now offices in Iowa would have a great group of people great group. Chuck is here someplace and staff and we have great people. But you know they said that back in the office you can multiply this times ten times ten. This is less than a day. So. And these are letters of horrible stories and horrible complaints. The waiting list as of last Wednesday was longer than a waiting list has ever been in the history of the V.A. the waiting list to see a doctor. OK. I mean. Who can do b etter than Trump. I fix things. I get things to work. I manage an so we'll wrap it up but I will say this. Look you have to understand we have a country. And my slogan I actually marked it up with copyright it. Can you believe because other people were using my slogan. They see I get by the way I get the biggest crowds I get the biggest standing ovations. Everybody knows that the press never reports it and the press doesn't understand that there's a room like this in another part of the building where it's packed also with its closed circuit. You people did better with real estate than they did but that's OK because I'm going oh I'm going over to see them right after this to say hello but they're hearing what we're saying. But the press is very dishonest the political press you know I've dealt with the financial press and you know look maybe it's simple because it's numbers you have that you have it you don't have maybe it's simple but. And by the way a lot of the a lot of the political press is great like 30 35 percent but some is so dishonest you'll have a meeting like this and the same the crowd was minuscule. Somebody said this the largest crowd they've ever had in Iowa here the whole thing. I mean that's what I've heard. I don't know but they'll say Mr. Trump spoke in front of a crowd you know record crowds. Mr. Trump spoke in front of a crowd. That is so dishonest it's so terrible. And you know one of the things I say is that I have an expression I used a lot in speeches. The American Dream is dead but I'm gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. OK. I mean I say that. APPLAUSE I say that. APPLAUSE And I say it a lot. The American Dream is dead and I'm gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. So I go home I see my wife and you know all my speeches alive. It's like the like when CNN LIVE ON FOX It's life. How do you like to do this you're always live on television and if you make one little mistake they'll say oh it's terrible. I'm on life everyone else. They don't even have cameras you know the other candidates they come there's no cameras with me all my life. My wife called up. Darling you live all over the world. I say Oh that's great. That makes me feel great. But you know what. I could do without it. I could do without it. So I say that the American dream is dead going to make it bigger. OK. So she said Darling that was terrible what you said today what you said the American dream is dead. I said no no but I'm going to make it. No no you didn't say that. You should have said that. Since should turn it on. You know the TiVo stuff right. I say turn it on. Let me see. And it has to be the American dream is dead click. And next subject and I go Whoa. Whoa that's bad right. No I go to like man. That's terrible. She was upset with me. She said Why didn't you say it properly. I said I did. So they have the America because you know how bad a statement that is. So the people in the room loved it but the people in the television didn't get to hear but make America great again. So I actually copyright it because I'm using that a lot and I think it's a great statement. I think it's a great statement. And all of the candidates have you know different statements. You know one of them has I think rise. I'm saying excuse me. Whose is that. Who's his rise. They have rise. Who's that. Who came up with the rise. That's not good. Probably paid a million dollars to some guy you know to come up with that one. No but I love to copyright it. So I actually won the copyright I got a cup. I didn't even know I could do that. Good lawyers. I have very good I'm very good with contracts don't you want that. Or do you want. You know a woman got up because I actually think I'm a nice guy I love people I have lots of fun in life. I've been great at what I do I've had big success I went to the best school I was a good student I got out I built a fortune I had a book The Art of the deal which everybody read probably right. Oh it's right there. Look at them. So so but it was a you know I guess the number one selling business book of all time. I do the show called The Apprentice. It becomes a big hit. Let's see how well it does without Trump. You know I told NBC I'm not doing it. They were angry at me. They came to my office. They had people from NBC and Comcast just before I announced they came to my office to see if I would not announce would I do the apprentice. And you know it's big it's a lot of money. Hey did you see. I put down two hundred and thirteen million dollars. That's what I made from the Apprentice. And you had some clowns on top. There's no way. And then I said I'll tell you what I'll bet a year's salary your salary not my salad because they made a mistake. I would. If you're right I'll pay you for yourself if you're wrong. We'll split it. You'll do it the other way right. So then I found out I was right. All right. Two hundred. So when I won I do you know when I say I'm not doing it. Ma rk Burnett called me good guy. He did the apprentice survivor you know. He said Donald you're turning down an extension nobody to let me tell you what I'm giving up not only there. But what I'm giving up in deals that I'm not done. It's here somebody said well how much will that campaign cost that's peanuts compared to what I'm giving up. That's peanuts. The campaign is my my smallest cause I'm doing it to make America great again. That's all. So what happened is a number of people started using that phrase and we actually can you believe this. I sent them legal as you know they were saying and will but they don't say it like I do. They will make America great again. Everyone says just another politician is not going to happen. We will make deals that are so good with foreign countries. Remember this we're being drained. We're being fleeced. We're being fleeced. The Iran deal. Twenty four days to go and think of that. You know it's funny. I love the idea of a nuclear deal but we got to do it from strength. We should have put the sanctions on double and triple and made the real deal not and not have a guy like Barak as not had a guy like Tony I mean I watched him on television the other day I said Is he right. Is he right. He's trying to justify 24 days. So first before you get to the 24 days it's a long process OK. You say we're going to do. They're going to fight you. That is probably take who knows how long it took. Then when the when it starts 20 by that time they can move all they can move whatever they want. They'll go Oh there are no missiles here. You know six months. Oh no this is lovely. Oh. They're so honorable. You know the Iranians is a great people and they are smart. They're great negotiators you know the Persians are great negotiators but there are two things we could talk about the accelerators we could talk about the feel we can talk about a lot that a lot of it you know I had an uncle who is great up at M.I.T. Dr. John Trump really smart guy. He said well you can do with this stuff. So they have all this period of time all this period of time. But there are two things that you can not ever justify. One is 24 days. And remember this is much longer because before that time limits such a whole process. So one is twenty four days can't be sold. Nobody can sell it. Why isn't it like immediate. You know they say anywhere any place etc. anytime. But why isn't it immediate. Why is it the media so you can't. So I'll tell you what the other thing you can't sell hostages. We'll get four people over of them and I guess you could say the third thing is a hundred and fifty billion dollars that we give them. So they are going to be I mean if they were a stock I would buy so much of Iran right now. I would do you know how good I did with picking stocks. You see that all those stocks went up I think 48 out of 50 is very good even though it's not even my business. I don't do stocks for the most part but I just looked and I said you know what it's like let's do some of this. And I was proud to do it in fact I sold them because I wanted people to see and they saw I had a great record. What was it like forty seven out of 52 or 51 went up. Well if I were a stock picker if I were a country picker you got to pick Iran because what we have done is we have made them a tremendous power an extraordinarily rich country think of it. We're giving them one hundred and fifty billion and much more. They're going to end up with nuclear. You're going to start. A nuclear revolution. People are going to you wait till you see what happens now with other countries. Israel is devastated as they should be. Israel has been hurt. I mean I don't get it. I have friends of mine that are Jewish that contribute to Obama and I say and smart people. I say What are you doing. What are you doing. It doesn't make sense. I don't understand it but Israel is going to be. I mean this is a real problem for Israel and it's a real problem for us. And then you see today I don't know. Did you see that the picture of Obama with a gun to his head was a caricature of Obama. Where the supreme leader. I see on NBC the other day they said the supreme leader not my supreme leader don't call him the supreme leader. It's a great term. That's like a term that Trump would use supreme leader. That's right. He like my supreme leader. So don't use that term say the leader of Iran. Don't say the supreme they say the supreme leader. And he said today or yesterday big big thing in the papers it says Don't mess with us don't mess with us. And you know the chief negotiator who I watched on television and as soon as I saw him I sai d this guy Kerry cannot deal with him cannot deal with him. It's a different level it's like the New England Patriots playing my high school football team. That's what it's like. That's what it's like. And you can't deal with them and you have to see you. I mean it's so devastating to see what happened. But the three things the money. OK. And then the other two things. Twenty four days. And why don't we get. So they said about the president's. This I mean. They said we didn't want to talk about the prisoners because it would complicate the negotiations. Think of this. You know what it is we will feathers we want our prisoners back before we start give them back to give it. If you have the right messenger there are people in this room could do a good. There are people who I would do a great walk in fellas before we start this should have been done before we start not at the end. We should have it done before this should have been done. I mean I call it the world's longest negotiation . OK just one no forever and we just kept giving up giving up giving up would say we'd like this. No. Oh how about this. No. We have nothing. But if you went in right at the beginning so here's the story. First of all you should have increased the sanctions have done or would have been very easy actually. That would have been almost as easy as it may be easier. But. But you say right at the beginning fellas no women in the room Sadly they haven't figured that one out that the women are smarter than the men but that's OK they'll figure it out. In about one hundred and fifty years they'll figure it out. You say fellas you don't want him. You don't need him. We need him up here. It'll be good for the deal. Let the prisoners out right now. Please let him out. Come on. Don't do it. We don't even ask. And then I see Kerry and Obama on television the other day saying it was too complicated too complicated. And yet according to certain papers a couple of years ago we gave them a nuclear sci entist. Does anyone even know that we gave them a nuclear scientist right. It's hard to believe how incompetent our country is run. So as so it's an honor to be with you and I will tell you if I'm elected president we will. And very quickly make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much."}
