This is amazing. Wow. Thank you, folks. Thank you. Redding, Redding. Oh, we love Redding. Thank you very much, everybody.","I think it's 104 degrees. Is everybody OK?","If anyone is not feeling well, come up here. We have plenty of water to share. This is hot out.","So, I want to thank you all. You know, they just got some very bad news. The worst jobs report in six-and-a-half years, OK? I don't know if you saw that -- 38,000 jobs. It's going the wrong way, folks. They've been kidding themselves. They're playing games. It's going the wrong way. They had a labor participate rate, it fell to 62.6, which is one of the worst in many, many, many years.","So we know what we're doing. We're going to turn it around. We're going to make America great again. We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to bring back our jobs.","And we're going to bring them back fast. So you remember the 1,237, right? And they said, Oh","She's working hard and she can't close it with Bernie. Good old Bernie. We love our Bernie, don't we? I'll tell you what. What a mess she's in. And the people that are with Bernie, they don't want to vote for her. They want to vote for Trump, a lot of them. You saw that poll just came out.","Because whether you like Bernie or not, he's right about one thing. Trade is a disaster for our country. That's the one thing he's right about. The trade deals that our country makes are an absolute disaster.","Hello, look at all those people over there. They're just crazy. Wow.","You know, I wish these camera guys would spin it around. They're so dishonest. It's unbelievable. To see it 100-and-something degrees out here, to have this number of people. Are we happy to be here?","And by the way, on June 7th, you have to get out and vote. Because, you know, we're setting records. We've already broken the record. In all fairness, we've already broken it.","Oh, I like that cap. He's got the same cap I have on. You like that, right? Hunters -- the NRA -- this is the NRA. They gave me the endorsement. You saw that.","They're great, great people. Lane and Chris, they're great people. They gave me the earliest endorsement I think they've ever given to anybody -- National Rifle Association, folks. We're going to protect your Second Amendment, believe me. We're going to protect -- we will protect your Second Amendment.","I love you, too. Nice guy over there. Big strong guy. I love you, Trump, but I love you.","So look, we've had an incredible period of time. June 16th we started and it's been an amazing ride. All over the world, they're talking about it. It's a movement. They say they've never seen anything like it. The biggest crowds of anybody by far.","The other night, Bernie had 3,000; I had 17,000. They said -- thank you.","And they talked about me, Donald Trump made a speech blah, blah, blah. Never mentioned the number of people. Then they talked about Bernie. Bernie Sanders had a massive crowd of 3","You know, they used to call it the silent majority; now I think we're going to call it the noisy majority. We're not silent anymore, folks. We're not silent.","And did you see last night in San Jose, we had an amazing packed crowd. It was packed and it was incredible and they had the basketball game which is -- you know, that area, the San Francisco game and we had some crowd. It was absolutely incredible and it was a lovefest inside, no problems whatsoever. We went on, we spoke, we had a good time for an hour. I said, I want to get you guys out to see -- you can see the San Francisco team","But I wanted to get them out. They said, No","Build that wall. You're right. We're going to build the wall, folks. Don't even think about it. You know, a lot of people -- you saw that I've got a lot of endorsements, and Paul Ryan just endorsed me and Mitch McConnell and everybody. But we got a lot of support. We have tremendous support.","I mean, when you think that, you know, in the history of our party, more votes than anybody that has ever done this before. Think of it. You know, think. More than Dwight Eisenhower. I mean, he won the second World War. More than Ronald Reagan, who we all love, more than anybody and we've got a lot of endorsements and we're very popular now within the party and polls are coming out showing we're doing very well and winning in some cases.","The Fox poll came out a few days ago and we're winning by three points. We're winning. We're beating Hillary. Did you see...","Did you see that phony speech she made yesterday? Every word -- and people think, oh, did she speak well. She's got two -- a teleprompter here and there. Did you ever notice Donald Trump is a bad man. Donald Trump has a bad tone. We need a tough tone in this country, folks. We don't need this kind of stuff anymore.","She said, I don't like the tone of Donald Trump.\" That was a while ago. She said","We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to take our country back. We're going to run it properly, folks. And you're going to be proud of your country again.","And you know, they do research. Good. I like that. USA, USA, USA. I like that. I like that.","So California, good place. By the way, I'm going to play heavy in California, right? I think we can win it. You know -- I mean, we get crowds like this all over the place. They didn't even give you a hangar. There's no hangar big enough. They don't even give hangars anymore. But it's amazing the kind of receptivity that we have.","And every magazine and every newspaper whether they like us or not -- and I say us because honestly, folks, I'm a messenger. Am I doing a good job as a messenger?","But I'm a messenger and it's incredible what's happened. And people are saying it's the most incredible political phenomenon -- I mean, they're actually saying -- that they've ever seen. One of the pundits told me the other day, and very strongly said, You know","I've been fighting them all my life. I like fighting them. But you've been fighting all of these people, and week after week you're down to 16, you're down to 14, you're down to 12. You're down to nine, seven, five, four, three, two, one.","And -- and they said there's never been anything like it. And they said it doesn't matter whether we win or lose, it's been incredible. It will be in the history books forever. They said it's never happened. Bill O'Reilly said the single greatest political phenomena he's ever seen in his life.","And I'm saying: What the hell are they talking about? We have to win, right? We have to win. We didn't come this far to lose.","So we're going to play California, because I think Hillary is very weak. I think she's pathetic. I think she should be in jail for what she did with her e-mails. OK?","She should be in jail. She should be in jail for what she did with those e-mails. Let me tell you, you know, she wants to play a little tough. You know, they go back and she polls it. Every word that she said was polled.","I don't poll. I don't have teleprompters here, folks. I don't need teleprompters. It's called, like, up here and it's called memory and it's called other things. And I -- I speak from here and from the heart. OK?","Because that's what we need. And every single thing she said yesterday was polled. And her people wrote it out and they don't see the teleprompters. And it makes it like, Oh","And these pundits -- if I ever did that, I'd be run out of town, believe me. They would get us -- vote for Hillary","We have to do this -- and South Korea. I mean, we're protecting South Korea from the maniac in the north, and we're protecting them.","Now, he actually said -- you know, I said this -- they said, Would you mind having negotiations with North Korea?\" No problem. Who the hell cares? You have a negotiation. I'm not going there. But you have a negotiation. They say","Who knows if the talks work. Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. They probably will, if you want to know the truth. Then Putin said, Donald Trump is a genius; he's going to be the next great leader of the United States.\" \"\"ho knows if the talks work. Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. They probably will","No, no. Think of it. So, they wanted me to disavow what he said. How dare you call me a genius? How dare you call me a genius, Vladimir? Never say a thing. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with Russia? Wouldn't that be good? I mean, is that a bad thing?","And I'm not talking from weakness, folks. I know all about negotiating from weakness and from strength. Hillary Clinton is a weak person. Hillary Clinton is totally scripted. Hillary Clinton is a thief. And Hillary Clinton should be in jail for what she did to our national security.","I mean, the only problem is I'd like to run against her, if you want to know the truth. But -- but she should be. What she's done is terrible.","So look, we have a -- I can't believe it. Look at all the people out there trying to get in. Hello, everybody. Look at those people. Look at that. Look at all those people out there. You guys have all the good . Why, they couldn't have -- they couldn't have pulled these fences a little bit further out?","But you don't want them to come in. You have enough people here, right? See, that's the way life works. Life is vicious.","So, when we talk about the different attributes, I mean you look at the word tone.\" But I'll use a different word. Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. She has bad judgment. You know","What China's doing with our intellectual property, stealing billions. We don't do anything about it during her regime.","But you look at what's going on. So here is Hillary all loused up with a simple e-mail system and you know, you ask why did she do it? I understand why she did it, because she's a thief, that's why she did it. But I get why she did it. But talk about judgment. How do you have a president with that kind of bad judgment?","She could have used the government stuff. She could have taken the government server, assume everybody's listening. I always do. Every time I pick up a phone, I assume people are listening. Now, you sue their ass off if they are if you can find them. You drop a little lawsuit on them and make them pay big league.","But you know what? For her to do what she did puts our country at risk. She's secretary of state. She's got people like Huma, who's -- Weiner -- Anthony Weiner -- she's the wife of Anthony Weiner. Now, how would you like Anthony Weiner to be having all these secrets? Well, guess what? She tells Anthony Weiner everything there is. I don't want -- I know Anthony Weiner. I don't want him knowing anything, folks. OK?","And I never ever want him to tweet me, right? Does anybody want him to tweet? No, I don't think. No, no. She's married to Anthony Weiner. She goes home, she tells -- like -- hey look, folks, that's the way life works. She goes home, she tells him everything. Who the hell wants that? This is not right, all right? It's not right.","Now, General Petraeus has suffered greatly. Many other people have suffered greatly for doing far less than what Hillary Clinton did. And you know what, folks? To me, as the woman just said, but she got away with it. It looks like she got away with it -- unless I win.","And everything will be fair, but we're going to have an attorney general and the attorney general's going to take a look and see, because you know there's a five-year or six-year statute of limitations. So she really is running for some pretty important reasons for herself.","Look, when somebody does something so wrong as that, they have to pay the consequences. She put our nation in difficulty. Did you see her I.T. specialist? He's taken the Fifth. The word is he's ratting her out like you wouldn't believe it, but they want to try and save her. That's not the way the government is supposed to work. They aren't supposed to be trying to save her, they're supposed to be doing the right thing.","But the press never -- it never lets up and it never follows that story. It never follows the real story. So do you remember in Iowa? I made a speech. And I said, you know, let's see -- let's raise some money for our vets, you know? And I figured maybe we'd raise half a million or a million or two million or something. But let's face it, we end up raising almost $6 million and I got bad publicity. Can you imagine? This can only happen to me, believe me.","I end up raising almost -- I have more calls and more e-mails and more tweets at realdonaldtrump, everybody. At realdonaldtrump. It's actually amazing. You know, if I tweet something, CNN and Fox, all of a sudden they say, We have breaking news. Donald Trump has --\" I'm sitting there tweeting","You know, we have like almost nine million on twitter, we've got a similar number on Facebook. On instagram, like a million and a half or something. We're soon going to be 20 million people. That's like owning the New York Times without the lawsuits, right? No, it's pretty good.","And then they say, You shouldn't use --\" you know","So we raised almost $6 million and the dishonest press -- they are so dishonest. Not all of them, but many of them. They are so dishonest, if I would have done nothing, it would have been fine. I said let's raise some money for the vets.","But I'm glad I did it because I have gotten more credit from the vets and more thank yous from the vets. We gave it out to many, many groups. I don't even know have many. But you know, they wake up and they get $100,000 in the mail, they get $150,000, they get $250,000. One of them got, I think, $1.1 million in the mail.","And they're great. I mean, they're great. They're great people. And they appreciate it -- so they appreciate it. It's fine. But they put the negative spin on everything. No matter what we do.","You know, it's funny. The New York Times puts me on -- what? Oh, get a medic, please. Medic. OK? OK. You just take it easy, darling. Take it easy. It's hot out here, right? Right over here -- medic. Right over here. Thank you.","We love you, man. We love you. Some of these people got here five, six hours ago.","How's that? Is she OK?","We want to make sure she's OK. She was here for five hours, they say -- five hours. Some of them here for seven, eight hours.","Hi. Oh, we love you. Are you OK, honey? Give her a hand, everybody.","Give her a hand.","That's great. She's tougher than all of us. And look at the medics and look at the police. What a great job they do, right? Isn't that right?","EMT. Give them a hand, by the way. Great job.","Thank you, darling.","All right. Good. She looks like she's in good shape. Thank you very much. That's true, though. The police and the medics and the firemen- and -women, and whatever, the job they do and they're not appreciated in this country. They're going to start being appreciated again, folks.","They're going to start.","How -- is she good? She's good over there? Everything good? That's good. That's good.","Thank you, honey.","So, we're going to do things that haven't been done in a long time. We're going to start winning again. We don't win anymore. We don't win anymore. Even a report like this you see today. It was like a bombshell. They were expecting 150,000, maybe 200,000 jobs; turns out to be 38,000. And they're bad jobs, folks.","You know, everybody, even the other side says we don't have good jobs anymore. Our good jobs are moving to Mexico, along with the companies that are moving there. They're moving to China, where China is making all our products. They keep devaluing their currency.","You know, I had a meeting today and I must have had 50 Chinese people there -- people from China or formerly from China. And they all love Trump. And CNN was there -- Jake Tapper was there. And we had an amazing time. They couldn't believe it. And John Dickerson, also a good guy, he was there from CBS. They were doing an interview. They looked outside: Who are all those people?\" They were people from China that are endorsing Trump. \"\"ou know","And they couldn't believe it. Nobody could believe it. And there was, like, love. And I don't blame the Chinese government. And I don't blame the Mexican government. I want our government to be smart. I want our government to get away with the kind of things they get away with.","But we have leaders that don't have a clue. And Hillary Clinton is at the top of the list. She's incompetent. Let's face it. First of all, she's always got problems -- Whitewater, impeachment, lies. He didn't have sex with that woman.\" Two months later","These are lying people. We don't need, folks, another four years of the Clintons. We don't need it. It's a mess.","It's a mess. So what we're going to do is we're going to have a strong temperament, not that weak temperament: I don't like his temperament; I don't like his tone.\" Well","Temperament is very important. It's very, very important. But we need strength. We don't need these weak people. That's all they do. They talk about, Well","Now, I could just say, you know, slough it off and say, Oh","Now, my temperament is totally controlled, so beautiful. I built an unbelievable company. I did so many great things.","I mean, I just came in and hi read about a school where the Clintons are involved where they've gotten $16 million and it's a scam. And I'm hearing -- why aren't they sued? Why aren't they sued? They scammed a school. Why aren't they being sued? It's a big story, but you know, these people don't want to talk about it.","Temperament is a very important word. We need toughness in tone. We need toughness in temperament. And frankly, I honestly believe it. I really mean this. I think that Hillary Clinton is unfit to lead our country, certainly at this time.","I think she's unfit. She doesn't have what it takes. You're going to go through four more years. I call her Obama light. I think it's going to be at least as bad and maybe worse. And think of what I said. They're scamming us with cyber. We're living in a cyber world. And here she is all screwed up with her e-mails. She doesn't know what the hell is going on. It's a mess. You talk about composure, you talk about temperament, you talk about all these things. Who would be so stupid to do what she did with her e-mails? I mean, who would be so stupid?","So, we are going to turn this country around. We are going to do things that are going to make you so proud of your president, but more much importantly, so proud of your country again because you know, when people say -- I deal with all these countries. I have great deals in all these countries. I have so many deals. And they laugh. They laugh at us. They say, What is going on?\" They don't believe it.\"\"o","Even the people from China this morning. You'll see because I think it's going to be on CNN, probably on CBS. You'll see. They're saying, No","You know, they know me. I don't know if they know I'm going to be revealing this, but they say, We can't believe -- we can't believe we get away with it.\" So we're going to turn it around.\"\"ou know","Now, a couple of things. We need strong borders. We've got to have borders. Either that or we don't have a country.","Sixteen-thousand five-hundred border patrol agents two weeks ago endorsed me. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. And I asked them -- I said to them -- I mean, what a perfect group to ask as opposed to some consultant that wants to suck you dry with fees that doesn't know anything, right? They know less than that beautiful young woman standing there. They know less, OK? All they know is how to get fees.","So I asked them when I was with the. I said, Let me ask you","Not going to be any ramps with my wall, folks. It's going to be a serious wall. It's going to be a real deal wall. It's going to be way up there. It's going to be a big, beautiful wall. And you know what? Someday, maybe they'll name it after Trump, but I'd much rather have a statue in Washington, D.C. Let's do a real good job.","So look -- so we're going to build that wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year, $58 billion. That's doesn't include the drugs that are pouring across the border, and yet we have companies moving into Mexico. They just took the world golf championship out of Miami and they brought it into Mexico. The people of Miami are furious. They brought it into Mexico. They signed like a six-year deal with Mexico.","They take everything. They take everything because we allow it to happen. But we're not going to allow it. As an example -- I use the example of Carrier Air Conditioning in Indiana. You know, we won Indiana big. Remember, that was going to be the firewall for other people running and it was a firewall. It was a firewall for me. I won in a landslide.","Thank you Bobby Knight, right? The great Bobby Knight. We love Bobby. And others, by the way. I mean, we had incredible -- we had incredible support. Lou Holtz came out and so many different people came out. And they supported me. And I knew I was going to win Indiana. They kept saying, We're going to win Indiana.\"\"\"hank you Bobby Knight","Let me tell you what I think. I think, and nobody else -- let's say Ted Cruz won, he wouldn't be here right now. Let's say somebody else won. They wouldn't be here right now. They gave up -- always give up on California as a Republican because they say you can't win.","I think we can win. I think we can win.","So we're going after California. We're going after the state of Washington. We're going after places that no other Republican goes after. Because, you know, we have a little bit of a tighter path. We have a few states that if we don't win them, it's over. Whereas the Democrats can lose numerous states and they can win.","So we have a tighter path. But I'm not your typical person. And when we come out -- Costa Mesa, we had 31,000 people. They hardly showed that because that was the day the kid was jumping on the police car breaking the hell out of it. And he probably wasn't arrested. You know, some people arrest.","You know, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, you know that.","Now, who's tougher at the border than Sheriff Joe? Between that and the Border Patrol, but Sheriff Joe totally endorsed me, right? Nobody tougher than Sheriff Joe. But he told me, and I saw this, they had a couple of people protesting. They put those people in jail so fast everyone else scattered in two seconds.","I said that's the way it has to be done. That's the way it has to be done. We need strength in our country. And I see it, but the thugs last night in San Jose. And then this Democrat mayor gets up. He said, Well","So we have an African American guy at one of the rallies a month ago. And he's sitting there behaving. And we had protesters inside the arena. And they were dressed in a Ku Klux Klan outfit, OK? And they're running around dressed as Ku Klux Klan.","And the place is booing and booing. This African American gets up and, man, he slugged these guys. He slugged them. And by that time, their hat was off because they got ripped off as they were running up the stairs. But this guy, a great guy -- I think he was a military guy for a long time. He slugged this guy wearing the Ku Klux Klan outfit.","But by the time he got up to the top, you couldn't see it was a Ku Klux Klan outfit. So when the African American cold-cocked this guy, this guy never knew what happened. Everybody thought the African American was against me. And it was the opposite. He was like this great guy, military guy. We have tremendous African American support. The reason is I'm going to bring jobs back to our country. We're going to bring jobs back.","But when these sleazy people, these dishonest people who never show the crowds. They never, ever show the crowds. When they showed that event, it made it look like the white guy was on my side. The African American guy said, I had enough","Let me tell you, while we're on the subject, we are going to bring jobs back to this country. We need our jobs. We're going to make it very expensive for companies to fire everybody and leave.","You know, your area has lost one in three manufacturing jobs over a fairly short period of time. That's a lot of manufacturing jobs. Your crime rate is way the hell up. You know that. I mean, I have these statistics. By the way, they're that way all over the place. When I go to Pennsylvania, we won that in a landslide. When I go to Connecticut, landslide; Maryland, landslide; Rhode Island, landslide; Delaware, landslide. The week before that, we had New York, super landslide.","You know what's nice? They know me in New York. They know me. We had three people running. I got 62 percent; won everything -- I mean, I won so much, people couldn't even believe it -- way, way above even projections. I knew I was going to win.","But isn't it nice, even for you, where the people that know me the best give me a tremendous vote of confidence, and we won it bigly .","And then you have these guys Charles Krauthammer. Donald Trump is not at 50 percent.\" I've got like 12 people running against me in some of these states","I listened to Krauthammer say it's the finest group of talent ever assembled in the history of the Republican Party. I looked at my wife, I said, You know","With that being said, we are going to build our military so powerful, so strong, nobody is going to mess with us. Our military is depleted. Did you see those things on Fox and CNN where they had a sort of documentary on what's going on with our flyers, right? We have these great airmen. And what's going on with our equipment? Where one of the airmen, I used to be so proud.\" Now","So they go into a plane graveyard -- you know, that's where they dump the old planes -- and they're stealing parts for our fighter jets and they're stealing parts from museums where they show the fighter jets. They're going in and they're taking parts because they want to be able to continue to fly. This is the United States. Can you imagine them doing that?","And then they spoke to these young pilots, these great guys, and they said, Well","So we have a lot of things to do and we're going to do things the right way. Hillary Clinton is not a talented person. She's not a natural. She wasn't meant for this job. She's greedy. She's greedy as hell, and that's, I think, the reason she wants it. But she doesn't have the talent for the job, she's not a natural for the job and she's just not a natural talent. And honestly, folks, look, beyond me, if you choose Hillary Clinton, this country is going to die. It's going to die. She's not respected by other countries.","When she goes -- she wont's ask -- as an example, when I said, Japan","You know, right now, we have to defend them from North Korea. If anything happens, we have to defend them. You know, though, and I say it to all -- to everybody, we defend them, but if something happens with us, we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. Now, think of it. That's our deal. Sergeant Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, they get five of the greatest killers that they have. They've been after them for nine years. I call them him the five-for-one president.","And that's the same thing with the Iran deal. We gave them $150 billion and that's the only time we got our prisoners back. We shouldn't have even started a negotiation until we got those prisoners back. And not once did this stiff -- he's a total stiff. John Kerry, not once did he get up from the bargaining table and say, Sorry","And by the way, the biggest loser in that deal aside from us is Israel. Israel is beside themselves over that deal. That deal is a disaster for Israel and a disaster for the Middle East, because you're going to have countries now start to arm up and arm up big. It's a disaster.","This is the president that we have and I believe that Hillary Clinton is going to be worse than Obama, OK? I believe she's got less talent than Obama, she has less natural ability than Obama and I'm not saying he has much because he doesn't. But he's got an agenda, folks because he has to have an agenda. Because nobody can be so stupid and nobody can make deals like this guy is making.","Now, remember this, remember this. Obama's been talking lately. He's been talking about Donald Trump. And normally, I wouldn't want to attack the president. I wouldn't want to say bad. I'd rather not. But once he speaks like Bill Clinton -- he started speaking. Now, he's been very quiet lately, very quiet.","But you know what? He started speaking. Once they attack, then we're allowed. So he's going to go out and campaign for Hillary. By the way, he doesn't like Hillary and Hillary hates Obama. You know that. She's hated him for years. Obama called Bill Clinton a racist. Bill Clinton hates Obama. And I know that for a personal fact.","But he hates Obama, hates him. The biggest surprise to me is that he made the speech at the convention for him. Honestly, because he hates Obama. Hillary Clinton can't stand Obama. But now Hillary will do anything he says. You know why? She doesn't want to go to jail. You noticed? The president all of a sudden, they were going to dissociate themselves from the president. All of a sudden, anything he wants, she'll do. Because it seems like they're protecting her.","Let's take the word seems\" out. OK? They are protecting her from going to jail. And she doesn't want to anger the president by saying","And that's what's happening, folks. We're going to have a whole different thing. Remember this about Obama. I always thought one thing -- I never thought he'd be a good president. I thought he'd be a great, really, healer. I thought he'd bring the country together. I thought he was going to be a good cheerleader.","He's been a disaster cheerleader.","No, no. I know what she said. It's, you know, hey, a lot of people say that, by the way.","But I thought it would bring the country together. He can't bring the country together. It's not -- it's not there. He's brought the country, and he's divided the country -- wealthy, less than wealthy, white, black. He's absolutely been the great divider. He's been a terrible president. Hillary Clinton will be worse, believe me. She's going to be worse. She's going to be worse.","She has a chance of being far worse. I mean, look at the deals. Look at the Libya deal. Look at it. And do you know who has that great Libyan oil? You know, it's among the finest oils in the world, right? It's high-oct, it's sweet. It is one of the fine oils in the world. You know who has it now? ISIS has it. ISIS.","Without that raid, you don't have Benghazi. I met with the fiance of the ambassador who was killed, yesterday. She's supporting Trump, a very nice woman. And she tells me stories about Hillary that are unbelievable, unbelievable; horrible stories about Hillary.","I mean, I said, Are you sure you're supporting me?\" Because I assumed she'd be like on the Democrat side. And she said","And remember the ads, the phony ads with Hillary? Who do you want answering your phone at three o'clock in the morning?\" She was sleeping. She was sleeping. She was sound asleep","You know, I say it was a terrible thing. And Benghazi has never really been picked up like it should be picked up because the press has never picked it up.","So here's the story, folks. It's an honor that you're here in this kind of heat. I know a number of you went down. I love you all. But I'll tell you what, you're going to be so happy, so proud. You've got to go out on June 7th. You've got to go out. You've got to go out.","You've got to vote. Because we're sending a mandate. That's a mandate. We already won. And we're now ahead by millions and millions of votes above the people that came in second. I won't even tell you who it is. But we're ahead by millions of votes.","But the more we have and the bigger the mandate we have, the stronger the movement is going to be. And then most importantly, get every one of your friends and in November, you have to go and vote. I'll be back. I'll be back. But in November -- in November, you have to go and vote.","Let me just tell you we're going to start winning again. We're going to win with our military. And we are going to knock the hell out of ISIS because we have no no . And it's going to go a lot faster and a lot easier than people understand. We're going to knock the hell out of them.","We're going to have strong borders. We're going to have the wall. We're going to be proud of our country again. We're going to make great trade deals. We're going to get rid of Common Core -- bring education locally. We're going to repeal Obamacare. Sixty percent -- think of it in Texas -- 60 percent Blue Cross Blue Shield -- 60 percent increase. Sixty. And it's going to be worse than that for other sections. November 1st they have to announce it. Worse. And don't let them take that November 1st announcement and make it December. Because that alone will destroy their chances of winning the presidency. Remember, don't let that happen, because they're trying to do it. They want to have a later announcement day.","So we're going to start winning with so many different elements of life and of our country. We're going to save our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to abolish it. Believe me. She wants to abolish our Second Amendment. We're going to save our Second Amendment.","And we're going to win. We're going to win at every single level. I often joke -- I joke. I have fun but it's really not joking. It's fact where I say we're going to win, win, win -- we're going to win so much. Friends of mine -- I have three or four friends, great friends in the audience, and I say they're going to come see me in the White House. Mr. President","And I'm going to say, I'm sorry. We're going to win","Remember this folks: America first. We don't put America first. We have these horrible, horrible trade negotiators. I actually think they're not as stupid as people think. I think that they actually want to help everybody else. They want to help everybody but our country. We are going to have a policy of America first. Make America first. Make America great again. We will do it. Get out on the seventh and vote and boy you better vote in November.","Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody. We love you. Thank you."],"text":" Wow. This is amazing. Wow. Thank you, folks. Thank you. Redding, Redding. Oh, we love Redding. Thank you very much, everybody. I think it's 104 degrees. Is everybody OK? If anyone is not feeling well, come up here. We have plenty of water to share. This is hot out. So, I want to thank you all. You know, they just got some very bad news. The worst jobs report in six-and-a-half years, OK? I don't know if you saw that -- 38,000 jobs. It's going the wrong way, folks. They've been kidding themselves. They're playing games. It's going the wrong way. They had a labor participate rate, it fell to 62.6, which is one of the worst in many, many, many years. So we know what we're doing. We're going to turn it around. We're going to make America great again. We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to bring back our jobs. And we're going to bring them back fast. So you remember the 1,237, right? And they said, Oh She's working hard and she can't close it with Bernie. Good old Bernie. We love our Bernie, don't we? I'll tell you what. What a mess she's in. And the people that are with Bernie, they don't want to vote for her. They want to vote for Trump, a lot of them. You saw that poll just came out. Because whether you like Bernie or not, he's right about one thing. Trade is a disaster for our country. That's the one thing he's right about. The trade deals that our country makes are an absolute disaster. Hello, look at all those people over there. They're just crazy. Wow. You know, I wish these camera guys would spin it around. They're so dishonest. It's unbelievable. To see it 100-and-something degrees out here, to have this number of people. Are we happy to be here? And by the way, on June 7th, you have to get out and vote. Because, you know, we're setting records. We've already broken the record. In all fairness, we've already broken it. Oh, I like that cap. He's got the same cap I have on. You like that, right? Hunters -- the NRA -- this is the NRA. They gave me the endorsement. You saw that. They're great, great people. Lane and Chris, they're great people. They gave me the earliest endorsement I think they've ever given to anybody -- National Rifle Association, folks. We're going to protect your Second Amendment, believe me. We're going to protect -- we will protect your Second Amendment. I love you, too. Nice guy over there. Big strong guy. I love you, Trump, but I love you. So look, we've had an incredible period of time. June 16th we started and it's been an amazing ride. All over the world, they're talking about it. It's a movement. They say they've never seen anything like it. The biggest crowds of anybody by far. The other night, Bernie had 3,000; I had 17,000. They said -- thank you. And they talked about me, Donald Trump made a speech blah, blah, blah. Never mentioned the number of people. Then they talked about Bernie. Bernie Sanders had a massive crowd of 3 You know, they used to call it the silent majority; now I think we're going to call it the noisy majority. We're not silent anymore, folks. We're not silent. And did you see last night in San Jose, we had an amazing packed crowd. It was packed and it was incredible and they had the basketball game which is -- you know, that area, the San Francisco game and we had some crowd. It was absolutely incredible and it was a lovefest inside, no problems whatsoever. We went on, we spoke, we had a good time for an hour. I said, I want to get you guys out to see -- you can see the San Francisco team But I wanted to get them out. They said, No Build that wall. You're right. We're going to build the wall, folks. Don't even think about it. You know, a lot of people -- you saw that I've got a lot of endorsements, and Paul Ryan just endorsed me and Mitch McConnell and everybody. But we got a lot of support. We have tremendous support. I mean, when you think that, you know, in the history of our party, more votes than anybody that has ever done this before. Think of it. You know, think. More than Dwight Eisenhower. I mean, he won the second World War. More than Ronald Reagan, who we all love, more than anybody and we've got a lot of endorsements and we're very popular now within the party and polls are coming out showing we're doing very well and winning in some cases. The Fox poll came out a few days ago and we're winning by three points. We're winning. We're beating Hillary. Did you see... Did you see that phony speech she made yesterday? Every word -- and people think, oh, did she speak well. She's got two -- a teleprompter here and there. Did you ever notice Donald Trump is a bad man. Donald Trump has a bad tone. We need a tough tone in this country, folks. We don't need this kind of stuff anymore. She said, I don't like the tone of Donald Trump.\" That was a while ago. She said We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to take our country back. We're going to run it properly, folks. And you're going to be proud of your country again. And you know, they do research. Good. I like that. USA, USA, USA. I like that. I like that. So California, good place. By the way, I'm going to play heavy in California, right? I think we can win it. You know -- I mean, we get crowds like this all over the place. They didn't even give you a hangar. There's no hangar big enough. They don't even give hangars anymore. But it's amazing the kind of receptivity that we have. And every magazine and every newspaper whether they like us or not -- and I say us because honestly, folks, I'm a messenger. Am I doing a good job as a messenger? But I'm a messenger and it's incredible what's happened. And people are saying it's the most incredible political phenomenon -- I mean, they're actually saying -- that they've ever seen. One of the pundits told me the other day, and very strongly said, You know I've been fighting them all my life. I like fighting them. But you've been fighting all of these people, and week after week you're down to 16, you're down to 14, you're down to 12. You're down to nine, seven, five, four, three, two, one. And -- and they said there's never been anything like it. And they said it doesn't matter whether we win or lose, it's been incredible. It will be in the history books forever. They said it's never happened. Bill O'Reilly said the single greatest political phenomena he's ever seen in his life. And I'm saying: What the hell are they talking about? We have to win, right? We have to win. We didn't come this far to lose. So we're going to play California, because I think Hillary is very weak. I think she's pathetic. I think she should be in jail for what she did with her e-mails. OK? She should be in jail. She should be in jail for what she did with those e-mails. Let me tell you, you know, she wants to play a little tough. You know, they go back and she polls it. Every word that she said was polled. I don't poll. I don't have teleprompters here, folks. I don't need teleprompters. It's called, like, up here and it's called memory and it's called other things. And I -- I speak from here and from the heart. OK? Because that's what we need. And every single thing she said yesterday was polled. And her people wrote it out and they don't see the teleprompters. And it makes it like, Oh And these pundits -- if I ever did that, I'd be run out of town, believe me. They would get us -- vote for Hillary We have to do this -- and South Korea. I mean, we're protecting South Korea from the maniac in the north, and we're protecting them. Now, he actually said -- you know, I said this -- they said, Would you mind having negotiations with North Korea?\" No problem. Who the hell cares? You have a negotiation. I'm not going there. But you have a negotiation. They say Who knows if the talks work. Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. They probably will, if you want to know the truth. Then Putin said, Donald Trump is a genius; he's going to be the next great leader of the United States.\" \"\"ho knows if the talks work. Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. They probably will No, no. Think of it. So, they wanted me to disavow what he said. How dare you call me a genius? How dare you call me a genius, Vladimir? Never say a thing. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with Russia? Wouldn't that be good? I mean, is that a bad thing? And I'm not talking from weakness, folks. I know all about negotiating from weakness and from strength. Hillary Clinton is a weak person. Hillary Clinton is totally scripted. Hillary Clinton is a thief. And Hillary Clinton should be in jail for what she did to our national security. I mean, the only problem is I'd like to run against her, if you want to know the truth. But -- but she should be. What she's done is terrible. So look, we have a -- I can't believe it. Look at all the people out there trying to get in. Hello, everybody. Look at those people. Look at that. Look at all those people out there. You guys have all the good . Why, they couldn't have -- they couldn't have pulled these fences a little bit further out? But you don't want them to come in. You have enough people here, right? See, that's the way life works. Life is vicious. So, when we talk about the different attributes, I mean you look at the word tone.\" But I'll use a different word. Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. She has bad judgment. You know What China's doing with our intellectual property, stealing billions. We don't do anything about it during her regime. But you look at what's going on. So here is Hillary all loused up with a simple e-mail system and you know, you ask why did she do it? I understand why she did it, because she's a thief, that's why she did it. But I get why she did it. But talk about judgment. How do you have a president with that kind of bad judgment? She could have used the government stuff. She could have taken the government server, assume everybody's listening. I always do. Every time I pick up a phone, I assume people are listening. Now, you sue their ass off if they are if you can find them. You drop a little lawsuit on them and make them pay big league. But you know what? For her to do what she did puts our country at risk. She's secretary of state. She's got people like Huma, who's -- Weiner -- Anthony Weiner -- she's the wife of Anthony Weiner. Now, how would you like Anthony Weiner to be having all these secrets? Well, guess what? She tells Anthony Weiner everything there is. I don't want -- I know Anthony Weiner. I don't want him knowing anything, folks. OK? And I never ever want him to tweet me, right? Does anybody want him to tweet? No, I don't think. No, no. She's married to Anthony Weiner. She goes home, she tells -- like -- hey look, folks, that's the way life works. She goes home, she tells him everything. Who the hell wants that? This is not right, all right? It's not right. Now, General Petraeus has suffered greatly. Many other people have suffered greatly for doing far less than what Hillary Clinton did. And you know what, folks? To me, as the woman just said, but she got away with it. It looks like she got away with it -- unless I win. And everything will be fair, but we're going to have an attorney general and the attorney general's going to take a look and see, because you know there's a five-year or six-year statute of limitations. So she really is running for some pretty important reasons for herself. Look, when somebody does something so wrong as that, they have to pay the consequences. She put our nation in difficulty. Did you see her I.T. specialist? He's taken the Fifth. The word is he's ratting her out like you wouldn't believe it, but they want to try and save her. That's not the way the government is supposed to work. They aren't supposed to be trying to save her, they're supposed to be doing the right thing. But the press never -- it never lets up and it never follows that story. It never follows the real story. So do you remember in Iowa? I made a speech. And I said, you know, let's see -- let's raise some money for our vets, you know? And I figured maybe we'd raise half a million or a million or two million or something. But let's face it, we end up raising almost $6 million and I got bad publicity. Can you imagine? This can only happen to me, believe me. I end up raising almost -- I have more calls and more e-mails and more tweets at realdonaldtrump, everybody. At realdonaldtrump. It's actually amazing. You know, if I tweet something, CNN and Fox, all of a sudden they say, We have breaking news. Donald Trump has --\" I'm sitting there tweeting You know, we have like almost nine million on twitter, we've got a similar number on Facebook. On instagram, like a million and a half or something. We're soon going to be 20 million people. That's like owning the New York Times without the lawsuits, right? No, it's pretty good. And then they say, You shouldn't use --\" you know So we raised almost $6 million and the dishonest press -- they are so dishonest. Not all of them, but many of them. They are so dishonest, if I would have done nothing, it would have been fine. I said let's raise some money for the vets. But I'm glad I did it because I have gotten more credit from the vets and more thank yous from the vets. We gave it out to many, many groups. I don't even know have many. But you know, they wake up and they get $100,000 in the mail, they get $150,000, they get $250,000. One of them got, I think, $1.1 million in the mail. And they're great. I mean, they're great. They're great people. And they appreciate it -- so they appreciate it. It's fine. But they put the negative spin on everything. No matter what we do. You know, it's funny. The New York Times puts me on -- what? Oh, get a medic, please. Medic. OK? OK. You just take it easy, darling. Take it easy. It's hot out here, right? Right over here -- medic. Right over here. Thank you. We love you, man. We love you. Some of these people got here five, six hours ago. How's that? Is she OK? We want to make sure she's OK. She was here for five hours, they say -- five hours. Some of them here for seven, eight hours. Hi. Oh, we love you. Are you OK, honey? Give her a hand, everybody. Give her a hand. That's great. She's tougher than all of us. And look at the medics and look at the police. What a great job they do, right? Isn't that right? EMT. Give them a hand, by the way. Great job. Thank you, darling. All right. Good. She looks like she's in good shape. Thank you very much. That's true, though. The police and the medics and the firemen- and -women, and whatever, the job they do and they're not appreciated in this country. They're going to start being appreciated again, folks. They're going to start. How -- is she good? She's good over there? Everything good? That's good. That's good. Thank you, honey. So, we're going to do things that haven't been done in a long time. We're going to start winning again. We don't win anymore. We don't win anymore. Even a report like this you see today. It was like a bombshell. They were expecting 150,000, maybe 200,000 jobs; turns out to be 38,000. And they're bad jobs, folks. You know, everybody, even the other side says we don't have good jobs anymore. Our good jobs are moving to Mexico, along with the companies that are moving there. They're moving to China, where China is making all our products. They keep devaluing their currency. You know, I had a meeting today and I must have had 50 Chinese people there -- people from China or formerly from China. And they all love Trump. And CNN was there -- Jake Tapper was there. And we had an amazing time. They couldn't believe it. And John Dickerson, also a good guy, he was there from CBS. They were doing an interview. They looked outside: Who are all those people?\" They were people from China that are endorsing Trump. \"\"ou know And they couldn't believe it. Nobody could believe it. And there was, like, love. And I don't blame the Chinese government. And I don't blame the Mexican government. I want our government to be smart. I want our government to get away with the kind of things they get away with. But we have leaders that don't have a clue. And Hillary Clinton is at the top of the list. She's incompetent. Let's face it. First of all, she's always got problems -- Whitewater, impeachment, lies. He didn't have sex with that woman.\" Two months later These are lying people. We don't need, folks, another four years of the Clintons. We don't need it. It's a mess. It's a mess. So what we're going to do is we're going to have a strong temperament, not that weak temperament: I don't like his temperament; I don't like his tone.\" Well Temperament is very important. It's very, very important. But we need strength. We don't need these weak people. That's all they do. They talk about, Well Now, I could just say, you know, slough it off and say, Oh Now, my temperament is totally controlled, so beautiful. I built an unbelievable company. I did so many great things. I mean, I just came in and hi read about a school where the Clintons are involved where they've gotten $16 million and it's a scam. And I'm hearing -- why aren't they sued? Why aren't they sued? They scammed a school. Why aren't they being sued? It's a big story, but you know, these people don't want to talk about it. Temperament is a very important word. We need toughness in tone. We need toughness in temperament. And frankly, I honestly believe it. I really mean this. I think that Hillary Clinton is unfit to lead our country, certainly at this time. I think she's unfit. She doesn't have what it takes. You're going to go through four more years. I call her Obama light. I think it's going to be at least as bad and maybe worse. And think of what I said. They're scamming us with cyber. We're living in a cyber world. And here she is all screwed up with her e-mails. She doesn't know what the hell is going on. It's a mess. You talk about composure, you talk about temperament, you talk about all these things. Who would be so stupid to do what she did with her e-mails? I mean, who would be so stupid? So, we are going to turn this country around. We are going to do things that are going to make you so proud of your president, but more much importantly, so proud of your country again because you know, when people say -- I deal with all these countries. I have great deals in all these countries. I have so many deals. And they laugh. They laugh at us. They say, What is going on?\" They don't believe it.\"\"o Even the people from China this morning. You'll see because I think it's going to be on CNN, probably on CBS. You'll see. They're saying, No You know, they know me. I don't know if they know I'm going to be revealing this, but they say, We can't believe -- we can't believe we get away with it.\" So we're going to turn it around.\"\"ou know Now, a couple of things. We need strong borders. We've got to have borders. Either that or we don't have a country. Sixteen-thousand five-hundred border patrol agents two weeks ago endorsed me. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. And I asked them -- I said to them -- I mean, what a perfect group to ask as opposed to some consultant that wants to suck you dry with fees that doesn't know anything, right? They know less than that beautiful young woman standing there. They know less, OK? All they know is how to get fees. So I asked them when I was with the. I said, Let me ask you Not going to be any ramps with my wall, folks. It's going to be a serious wall. It's going to be a real deal wall. It's going to be way up there. It's going to be a big, beautiful wall. And you know what? Someday, maybe they'll name it after Trump, but I'd much rather have a statue in Washington, D.C. Let's do a real good job. So look -- so we're going to build that wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year, $58 billion. That's doesn't include the drugs that are pouring across the border, and yet we have companies moving into Mexico. They just took the world golf championship out of Miami and they brought it into Mexico. The people of Miami are furious. They brought it into Mexico. They signed like a six-year deal with Mexico. They take everything. They take everything because we allow it to happen. But we're not going to allow it. As an example -- I use the example of Carrier Air Conditioning in Indiana. You know, we won Indiana big. Remember, that was going to be the firewall for other people running and it was a firewall. It was a firewall for me. I won in a landslide. Thank you Bobby Knight, right? The great Bobby Knight. We love Bobby. And others, by the way. I mean, we had incredible -- we had incredible support. Lou Holtz came out and so many different people came out. And they supported me. And I knew I was going to win Indiana. They kept saying, We're going to win Indiana.\"\"\"hank you Bobby Knight Let me tell you what I think. I think, and nobody else -- let's say Ted Cruz won, he wouldn't be here right now. Let's say somebody else won. They wouldn't be here right now. They gave up -- always give up on California as a Republican because they say you can't win. I think we can win. I think we can win. So we're going after California. We're going after the state of Washington. We're going after places that no other Republican goes after. Because, you know, we have a little bit of a tighter path. We have a few states that if we don't win them, it's over. Whereas the Democrats can lose numerous states and they can win. So we have a tighter path. But I'm not your typical person. And when we come out -- Costa Mesa, we had 31,000 people. They hardly showed that because that was the day the kid was jumping on the police car breaking the hell out of it. And he probably wasn't arrested. You know, some people arrest. You know, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, you know that. Now, who's tougher at the border than Sheriff Joe? Between that and the Border Patrol, but Sheriff Joe totally endorsed me, right? Nobody tougher than Sheriff Joe. But he told me, and I saw this, they had a couple of people protesting. They put those people in jail so fast everyone else scattered in two seconds. I said that's the way it has to be done. That's the way it has to be done. We need strength in our country. And I see it, but the thugs last night in San Jose. And then this Democrat mayor gets up. He said, Well So we have an African American guy at one of the rallies a month ago. And he's sitting there behaving. And we had protesters inside the arena. And they were dressed in a Ku Klux Klan outfit, OK? And they're running around dressed as Ku Klux Klan. And the place is booing and booing. This African American gets up and, man, he slugged these guys. He slugged them. And by that time, their hat was off because they got ripped off as they were running up the stairs. But this guy, a great guy -- I think he was a military guy for a long time. He slugged this guy wearing the Ku Klux Klan outfit. But by the time he got up to the top, you couldn't see it was a Ku Klux Klan outfit. So when the African American cold-cocked this guy, this guy never knew what happened. Everybody thought the African American was against me. And it was the opposite. He was like this great guy, military guy. We have tremendous African American support. The reason is I'm going to bring jobs back to our country. We're going to bring jobs back. But when these sleazy people, these dishonest people who never show the crowds. They never, ever show the crowds. When they showed that event, it made it look like the white guy was on my side. The African American guy said, I had enough Let me tell you, while we're on the subject, we are going to bring jobs back to this country. We need our jobs. We're going to make it very expensive for companies to fire everybody and leave. You know, your area has lost one in three manufacturing jobs over a fairly short period of time. That's a lot of manufacturing jobs. Your crime rate is way the hell up. You know that. I mean, I have these statistics. By the way, they're that way all over the place. When I go to Pennsylvania, we won that in a landslide. When I go to Connecticut, landslide; Maryland, landslide; Rhode Island, landslide; Delaware, landslide. The week before that, we had New York, super landslide. You know what's nice? They know me in New York. They know me. We had three people running. I got 62 percent; won everything -- I mean, I won so much, people couldn't even believe it -- way, way above even projections. I knew I was going to win. But isn't it nice, even for you, where the people that know me the best give me a tremendous vote of confidence, and we won it bigly . And then you have these guys Charles Krauthammer. Donald Trump is not at 50 percent.\" I've got like 12 people running against me in some of these states I listened to Krauthammer say it's the finest group of talent ever assembled in the history of the Republican Party. I looked at my wife, I said, You know With that being said, we are going to build our military so powerful, so strong, nobody is going to mess with us. Our military is depleted. Did you see those things on Fox and CNN where they had a sort of documentary on what's going on with our flyers, right? We have these great airmen. And what's going on with our equipment? Where one of the airmen, I used to be so proud.\" Now So they go into a plane graveyard -- you know, that's where they dump the old planes -- and they're stealing parts for our fighter jets and they're stealing parts from museums where they show the fighter jets. They're going in and they're taking parts because they want to be able to continue to fly. This is the United States. Can you imagine them doing that? And then they spoke to these young pilots, these great guys, and they said, Well So we have a lot of things to do and we're going to do things the right way. Hillary Clinton is not a talented person. She's not a natural. She wasn't meant for this job. She's greedy. She's greedy as hell, and that's, I think, the reason she wants it. But she doesn't have the talent for the job, she's not a natural for the job and she's just not a natural talent. And honestly, folks, look, beyond me, if you choose Hillary Clinton, this country is going to die. It's going to die. She's not respected by other countries. When she goes -- she wont's ask -- as an example, when I said, Japan You know, right now, we have to defend them from North Korea. If anything happens, we have to defend them. You know, though, and I say it to all -- to everybody, we defend them, but if something happens with us, we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. Now, think of it. That's our deal. Sergeant Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, they get five of the greatest killers that they have. They've been after them for nine years. I call them him the five-for-one president. And that's the same thing with the Iran deal. We gave them $150 billion and that's the only time we got our prisoners back. We shouldn't have even started a negotiation until we got those prisoners back. And not once did this stiff -- he's a total stiff. John Kerry, not once did he get up from the bargaining table and say, Sorry And by the way, the biggest loser in that deal aside from us is Israel. Israel is beside themselves over that deal. That deal is a disaster for Israel and a disaster for the Middle East, because you're going to have countries now start to arm up and arm up big. It's a disaster. This is the president that we have and I believe that Hillary Clinton is going to be worse than Obama, OK? I believe she's got less talent than Obama, she has less natural ability than Obama and I'm not saying he has much because he doesn't. But he's got an agenda, folks because he has to have an agenda. Because nobody can be so stupid and nobody can make deals like this guy is making. Now, remember this, remember this. Obama's been talking lately. He's been talking about Donald Trump. And normally, I wouldn't want to attack the president. I wouldn't want to say bad. I'd rather not. But once he speaks like Bill Clinton -- he started speaking. Now, he's been very quiet lately, very quiet. But you know what? He started speaking. Once they attack, then we're allowed. So he's going to go out and campaign for Hillary. By the way, he doesn't like Hillary and Hillary hates Obama. You know that. She's hated him for years. Obama called Bill Clinton a racist. Bill Clinton hates Obama. And I know that for a personal fact. But he hates Obama, hates him. The biggest surprise to me is that he made the speech at the convention for him. Honestly, because he hates Obama. Hillary Clinton can't stand Obama. But now Hillary will do anything he says. You know why? She doesn't want to go to jail. You noticed? The president all of a sudden, they were going to dissociate themselves from the president. All of a sudden, anything he wants, she'll do. Because it seems like they're protecting her. Let's take the word seems\" out. OK? They are protecting her from going to jail. And she doesn't want to anger the president by saying And that's what's happening, folks. We're going to have a whole different thing. Remember this about Obama. I always thought one thing -- I never thought he'd be a good president. I thought he'd be a great, really, healer. I thought he'd bring the country together. I thought he was going to be a good cheerleader. He's been a disaster cheerleader. No, no. I know what she said. It's, you know, hey, a lot of people say that, by the way. But I thought it would bring the country together. He can't bring the country together. It's not -- it's not there. He's brought the country, and he's divided the country -- wealthy, less than wealthy, white, black. He's absolutely been the great divider. He's been a terrible president. Hillary Clinton will be worse, believe me. She's going to be worse. She's going to be worse. She has a chance of being far worse. I mean, look at the deals. Look at the Libya deal. Look at it. And do you know who has that great Libyan oil? You know, it's among the finest oils in the world, right? It's high-oct, it's sweet. It is one of the fine oils in the world. You know who has it now? ISIS has it. ISIS. Without that raid, you don't have Benghazi. I met with the fiance of the ambassador who was killed, yesterday. She's supporting Trump, a very nice woman. And she tells me stories about Hillary that are unbelievable, unbelievable; horrible stories about Hillary. I mean, I said, Are you sure you're supporting me?\" Because I assumed she'd be like on the Democrat side. And she said And remember the ads, the phony ads with Hillary? Who do you want answering your phone at three o'clock in the morning?\" She was sleeping. She was sleeping. She was sound asleep You know, I say it was a terrible thing. And Benghazi has never really been picked up like it should be picked up because the press has never picked it up. So here's the story, folks. It's an honor that you're here in this kind of heat. I know a number of you went down. I love you all. But I'll tell you what, you're going to be so happy, so proud. You've got to go out on June 7th. You've got to go out. You've got to go out. You've got to vote. Because we're sending a mandate. That's a mandate. We already won. And we're now ahead by millions and millions of votes above the people that came in second. I won't even tell you who it is. But we're ahead by millions of votes. But the more we have and the bigger the mandate we have, the stronger the movement is going to be. And then most importantly, get every one of your friends and in November, you have to go and vote. I'll be back. I'll be back. But in November -- in November, you have to go and vote. Let me just tell you we're going to start winning again. We're going to win with our military. And we are going to knock the hell out of ISIS because we have no no . And it's going to go a lot faster and a lot easier than people understand. We're going to knock the hell out of them. We're going to have strong borders. We're going to have the wall. We're going to be proud of our country again. We're going to make great trade deals. We're going to get rid of Common Core -- bring education locally. We're going to repeal Obamacare. Sixty percent -- think of it in Texas -- 60 percent Blue Cross Blue Shield -- 60 percent increase. Sixty. And it's going to be worse than that for other sections. November 1st they have to announce it. Worse. And don't let them take that November 1st announcement and make it December. Because that alone will destroy their chances of winning the presidency. Remember, don't let that happen, because they're trying to do it. They want to have a later announcement day. So we're going to start winning with so many different elements of life and of our country. We're going to save our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to abolish it. Believe me. She wants to abolish our Second Amendment. We're going to save our Second Amendment. And we're going to win. We're going to win at every single level. I often joke -- I joke. I have fun but it's really not joking. It's fact where I say we're going to win, win, win -- we're going to win so much. Friends of mine -- I have three or four friends, great friends in the audience, and I say they're going to come see me in the White House. Mr. President And I'm going to say, I'm sorry. We're going to win Remember this folks: America first. We don't put America first. We have these horrible, horrible trade negotiators. I actually think they're not as stupid as people think. I think that they actually want to help everybody else. They want to help everybody but our country. We are going to have a policy of America first. Make America first. Make America great again. We will do it. Get out on the seventh and vote and boy you better vote in November. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody. We love you. Thank you."}
